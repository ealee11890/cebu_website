        <h3>The Holiest Halo-Halo</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b>
          <p>The quest for our holy grail, a bowl containing the best halo-halo in Cebu, had begun without our knowing it.  We had had two orders of the dessert thus far, 
            enough to make Michael and Liz and Andy keenly aware of its availability.  Like a virus, the craving bided its time in our bodies.  Friday, no halo-halo was to 
            be had.  We ate lunch at home, having slept in from the night before.  Andrew and Monette came by with their girls, who had skipped school to spend time with 
            their cousins.  Hannah and Bianca were several years younger than Andy.  Both were talented at drawing, as their sketches on the dining table showed.  Andrew 
            had a handicraft-manufacturing business, and he brought with him a bag of souvenirs from his inventory—keychains and refrigerator magnets that were more colorful 
            than the Jelly Belly beans I gave my mother.</p>
          <p>That afternoon, Andrew drove us to a spa so we could get a massage.  Michael stayed home.  On the way there, I asked my brother to stop by my old school, 
            the University of San Carlos, which I had not seen since 1983.  He obliged. </p> 
          <p>We got there and entered the lobby.  Two security guards waved us through after I deposited my driver’s license with them.</p>
          <p>No one I knew still worked there.  What had I expected?</p>  
          <p>Well, actually I had hoped that the whole place was exactly the same as when I left it, not one iota changed, the litter unswept from 1983, everything unaltered 
            as though encased in ash, as in post-eruption Pompeii.  I wanted to be 23 years old again, to be spry, and ignorant of tax liabilities and life insurance policies 
            and colonoscopy appointments.</p>
          <p>But the place was different.  Liz touched my arm and said, “Dad, you okay?”  Liz—my firstborn, three years older than my fantasized age.</p>   
          <p>“I think so,” I murmured.  “Everything’s gone.”</p>
          <p>Later, someone told me that only the colleges of law and commerce remained in that campus.  All the others had been transferred to the old engineering campus 
            in Talamban, out in the hills and now greatly expanded.</p>  
          <p>The place was different also in that the paint was of a deeper hue than the light green and tan combination I remembered.  The grounds were basically the same, 
            though here and there additions were in evidence: an annex, a passageway, window air-conditioning units.  But the old concrete gym was intact, its roof like the 
            shell of a gargantuan tortoise; so too the quadrangle, still leafy in its quietude.  In that gym, in 1979, I had won an extemporaneous-speaking contest, the trophy 
            for which I still possessed, buried somewhere in my suburban basement.  Across that quadrangle, I used to stroll as a psych major, and then, more briskly, stride 
            as a psych instructor.  Female undergraduates, so the story went, would hush their voices when I approached, and would blush and giggle like schoolgirls.  As a 
            graduate of psychology, I had my theories about their behavior, but modesty forbids me now from explicating.</p> 
          <p>Andrew mentioned that there was a plan to sell the property, an entire city block of classrooms redolent with scholarship, administrative offices, athletic fields, 
            the Tolkienesque gym, priests’ quarters, faculty lounges—this hallowed grove of academia—to a developer.  It made financial sense, but it sounded obscene.  Must 
            everything have an expiration date?  The Hanging Gardens of Babylon…the British Empire…American conservatism; all gone.</p> 
          <p>After our tour of the university, we headed for the massage parlor, and ran into traffic as dense as kudzu in an Alabama wood.</p>  
          <p>Driving in the Philippines is not like driving in America; which is to say, it isn’t driving at all so much as it is one continuous avoidance of vehicular 
            homicide.  On one level, it works; people do successfully get from point A to point B.  Ariston, in Bohol, showed us how magnificently and mysteriously the 
            system could work.  On another level—the one I’m familiar with—it’s nuts.  Traffic signs and pavement markings are typically ignored, though traffic lights 
            are occasionally and provisionally heeded.  The concept of a right-of-way does not exist in a Filipino motorist’s mind.  The rule is: first-come-first-served—first 
            one to the spot gets to turn or move, whether the spot is across two solid yellow lines, or in oncoming traffic, or over a pedestrian’s cold body.  To a Westerner, 
            and particularly to one like me, prone to straying toward either end of the autism spectrum, the chaos was maddening.  A demolition derby which resulted in no 
            demolition at all led to cognitive dissonance.  So, sitting without a seatbelt in Andrew’s Toyota, I leaned back on the couch, as it were, and played psychiatrist.</p>  
          <p>There must be a cultural algorithm at work on Philippine roads, allowing multiple automobiles to enter a given intersection simultaneously and not hit one another.  
              This algorithm, operating solely in each driver’s head, directs the vehicles to snake around one another, one fender daring another without quite challenging it, 
              until the vehicles, unscathed, get through the morass of their own creation.  As far as I could tell, not one eyelid was ever batted or an expletive uttered in 
              the whole process.  The algorithm is perfect; the drivers’ reactions are honed to near reflex; everyone’s expectations are delineated.</p>
          <p>Over breakfast in Bohol, the day before, Michael had talked about driverless-car technology and how, when every vehicle on the road was self-driving, it would be 
            possible to control each one via some central computer at an intersection.  That computer would receive data wirelessly from each car, with regard to its size and 
            velocity and pre-programmed destination, and calculate a scenario by which all those cars could enter the intersection at the same time.  More to the point, the 
            cars would cross seamlessly to the other side, without benefit of human judgment or the risk of human error.  The familiar red, yellow and green traffic lights 
            would be thrown into the same heap of obsolescence inaugurated by the first horse-and-buggy discards.  Michael had a master’s degree in computer science, and 
            believed such a world as he had described was coming.  What he did not realize was that Filipino drivers, without benefit of sensors or digital guidance, were 
            already executing some semblance of this magically orchestrated traffic.</p>  
          <p>My muscles ached from analyzing the situation.  It was just as well we were on our way to get our backs and limbs massaged.</p> 
          <p>We were an hour late to our appointment—a delay accounted for in the same effective cultural algorithm, and thus within the parameters of normalcy.</p>
          <p>For six U.S. dollars, you can have an hour-long, full-body massage in Cebu.  The service commenced, for me, with a girl washing my feet from a bowl.  That alone, 
            in the States, would have cost ten bucks, plus a guilt tax.  My masseuse then led me to a private cubicle, in the center of which was a tall, narrow bed with a hole 
            to accommodate my face.  Soft instrumental music was piped in—angels’ harps from heaven.  The light was dim.  I felt sheepish being the beneficiary of such royal 
            treatment.</p>  
          <p>Six bucks really?</p>    
          <p>The massage began, or must have begun, with my back…down the ridges of my spine…along the contours of my neck and temples, continuing to my arms and fingers, and 
            thence to my thighs and calves and ankles and feet, each toe getting its own special rub-down.  No cadaver ever received as much attention on a dissecting table as 
            did my luxuriantly breathing body on that upholstered bed.  The girl mussed up my hair as she dug into my scalp.  Though shy and deferential, she was skilled and 
            strong, confidently twisting my limbs, slapping my flesh, treating me, in general, like an expensive cut of meat.  I was covered in oil (canola?), naked except for 
            the towel over my underwear.  Next door, Elizabeth sighed euphoniously.  Somewhere else in the facility, some boor was snoring.  Who knew life could be so unreal?  
            We might as well have dwelt in Hinagdanan Cave.</p>
          <p>The hour melted away, like those clocks in the Dali painting.  The session was over.  Someone came in with some jasmine tea, which I sipped, my fingers slippery on 
            the cup handle.  Donning my clothes, I met up with my group at the front counter, and we paid up.  Virginia’s bill was lower since she had opted for the foot massage 
            only.  In the car later, Virginia would complain that her masseuse had gotten carried away and done her body as well, which had discomfited her.  Life is tough in 
            there, I thought.  But I didn’t say anything, for I had become wise in addition to being pleasantly sore.</p>  
          <p>“How was your foot massage, Uncle Andrew?” Andy asked his uncle.</p>
          <p>“Umm, okay,” my brother replied.</p>
          <p>“Did she do your other foot too?”</p>
          <p>My brother didn’t know what to make of this query, and merely stared at the traffic before him, still dense as kudzu in an Alabama wood.  I looked at my son’s face 
            in the rear-view mirror.  He had on that expression he affected when he was being oh so witty.  Finally my brother told us the bad news.  Traffic wasn’t moving; it 
            was “exceptionally bad,” according to him.  Around us was a jumble of vehicles, Lego bricks that some giant toddler had spilled.  Perhaps the cultural algorithm I 
            had earlier hypothesized had a psychological or mathematical limit after all.  Michael wasn’t there to offer any feedback or solution.  Andrew suggested we turn into 
            Montebello Hotel, which was nearby, and have dinner there while waiting for the rush-hour logjam to clear.  He called mom to say we weren’t going to be home for dinner.  
            I glanced at the rear-view mirror again, to see Elizabeth frowning.  She was worried about Michael being alone in a strange house—Michael, who had been to twenty 
            different countries, including the Neverland of Bohol.  It was touching.</p>
          <p>Andrew turned right into a side street and wound down another one, emerging into a parking lot.  The hotel, squat and floridly decorated, lay before us, a trio of 
            security guards flanking its entrance.</p>   
          <p>“This is Montebello?” I gasped, incredulous.  In my day, Montebello was out in the country, deep behind some corn fields.  It was the loveliest hotel in town.  I 
            spent weekends there on production meetings for a television variety show I hosted, back in the heyday of my fame, the good old days of bohemian insouciance.  Now 
            Montebello was located behind a shopping center, in the shadow of a massive convention building that resembled a maharajah’s palace.  It threw my cognitive map of 
            Cebu out of kilter.  Like Alice, I didn’t know whether I had shrunk or whether the earth had expanded.</p>   
          <p>We walked past the swimming pool, and took our seats at a table.  Waiters in barong shirts were serving their customers, well-to-do locals and elderly white 
            expatriates.  The Bermuda grass glowed in the lowering sun.  A musician was playing jazz on a terrace.  Suddenly I wanted to retire from the U.S. Postal Service, 
            and book a room there on a monthly basis.  Somewhere on the grounds of the hotel was another room, where in the early 1980’s my parents brought us all to Sunday 
            worship.  Two American missionaries were co-pastoring our congregation, during my mother’s water-slide transition from Catholicism to mere Christianity.  And now 
            here we were, I with my own family of believers, ordering an unholy combo of lasagna and garlic rice.  A full circle had been drawn, all because of a traffic jam.</p>
          <p>Because Michael was absent, we did not order halo-halo.</p>
          <p>When we got home that night, my mom had dinner waiting for us anyway.  She likes to have her own way; likes to see her loved ones munching on something.  Michael was 
            alive, apparently unharmed by the maid.  Perhaps Adrian had protected him.  Adrian is a good soul, as I’ve mentioned.  He was wearing the Chicago Blackhawks hat I 
            gave him when we first arrived, but the bad-ass hat did little to diminish the gentleness of Adrian’s demeanor.</p>  
          <p>We visited the Chapel of San Pedro Calungsod the next morning.  I had seen a photo of this church in an Architectural Digest magazine prior to our trip, and when I 
            read that it was located in Cebu City, I determined that I would see it in person.  The church, a modernist building, consisted of a series of vertical slabs of 
            unadorned stucco.  The slabs rose to different heights, past an inconspicuous flat roof—a striking design.  The interior was not as impressive, except for its sheer 
            volume.  The altar, sanctuary, pews and peripheral spaces lacked originality, and up close, the quality of the construction appeared suspect.  Walls did not align 
            perfectly; wood had begun to warp.  The slabs of white stucco turned out to be hollow, a realization which deflated my spirit, as if architecture were intrinsic to 
            religion.  Gothic cathedrals, for one, never disappoint.  Their arches and buttresses, columns, kaleidoscopic windows and glorious statuary combine to point toward 
            majesty and eternity.  The Calungsod Church—not so much.  Its Stations of the Cross consisted of cheesy plaster.  I saw no bronze and precious little steel.  The 
            glass did not catch the eye.  The entire edifice sat on newly reclaimed land, according to Gus, and already the floor had settled.</p>  
          <p>Liz, who had a degree in architecture, did not join in our inspection.  In five years, she had probably had enough of architecture talk, and Gus and I reminded her 
            of her professors.</p>  
          <p>We had ridden with Gus that morning.  Again he had taken time off from his conference to show us around.  Gus was an architect; a very private person.  He lived 
            in a condo.  He was the best man at my wedding.  His wife had passed away some years before.  They had had no children.  Growing up, he was my buddy: quiet and 
            competent.  We understood each other, being close in age.  We agreed that the Chapel of San Pedro Calungsod, called the “Church of Walls” by the international press, 
            was not first-rate, except in photographs.</p>
          <p>Across the church was SM Seaside City, a circular, multi-story mall.  Here we spent the rest of the morning, sucking smoothies from a straw, and ogling the high-end 
            shops and boutiques which gleamed on every floor.  We saw an Ace Hardware store that looked nothing like the Ace Hardware stores we knew in America.  It was bathed in 
            fluorescence, like a drug store; it was as clean as a clinic, and snootier than a Lexus dealership’s showroom.  Michael and Andy and I stared at it, stupefied.  In Cebu?  
            At a mall?  Three floors up, beside the skin-care emporium?  Did it limit to elite clientele access to its hinges and door knobs?  Why the security guards by the Weber 
            grills?  But Virginia and Elizabeth had walked on, lingering in front of the skin-care emporium.</p>
          <p>Gus wanted to know if we had never seen an Ace Hardware store.</p>
          <p>“Not at this level,” admitted Andy.  “Not even in Ames.”</p>
          <p>Ames, Iowa: where Andy had gone to college and studied engineering and learned to be funny.</p>
          <p>We found ourselves on the roof (yes, the very roof) of the mall.  The panorama from this vantage point was unsurpassed; you could see the sea and the ships on it, and 
            farther off, islands shimmering like promises.  The heavens encompassed the horizon.  The roof itself was a tidy little park, complete with grass, palm trees, public 
            sculpture and benches.  We took pictures.  It was then that I noticed, off to the north, down in the dirt, the rusty quilt colors of a shanty-town’s corrugated rooftops.</p>    
          <p>“What part of town is that?” I asked Gus, pointing north.
            Gus cocked his head.  “That must be Pasil,” he answered.
            Pasil, even back before I left the country, was a slum, a warren of hiding places and fishmongers’ shacks.  Thieves on the run ran there.  Away from the regular poor, 
            the poor who had lost all hope clutched the last dregs of human solace in Pasil.  And there it was in 2016, seen from a safe distance (as usual) by me and my ilk: 
            still a dump and still desperate.</p>
          <p>In Kuala Lumpur and maybe even in Bangkok, such a slum would already have been cleared, replaced with decent, affordable housing—not neighborhoods of bungalows and 
            rose gardens, by any means, but multi-unit blocks of apartments; tiny and spare, a place where a family could hang curtains over a window.  Why didn’t Cebu have 
            more boring middle-class housing and fewer makeshift sheds lining the streets?  Who was buying all that gorgeous stuff displayed in the malls, and ordering all 
            the fine entrees on the menus?  I saw enough of the folks in jeans and polo shirts, but also far too many unshod children, men and women in ragged clothes—“dead,” 
            as Markham portrays them, “to rapture and despair.”  One didn’t have to be an economist to understand that earning $2,500 annually, one-fifth of the world’s average, 
            would not get a consumer very far down the shopping aisle.  It was nothing new.  The poor would always be with us, as Christ predicted; but did they have to be so 
            numerous?  So numerous they were invisible?  Was socialism the answer?  Not if present-day Venezuela was any indication.  I was on chapter thirteen of The Forgotten 
            Man, two hundred pages read since Detroit Metro Airport.  Capitalism?  Done right, you end up with places like Singapore and Shenzhen.  Done half-right, you wind up 
            with twenty families owning half the city.  In Cebu, the Sys and Gaisanos and Aboitezes and others of their clique marked their territories sharply.  They owned 
            swaths of the retail industry, hotels and schools, real estate developments, transportation and, under the table, a good chunk of the government.  H. Lhuillier 
            pawnshops dotted the urban landscape, ubiquitous as weeds.  Near the top of the food chain stood an Ace Hardware Store with an attitude.  And in between?</p>  
          <p>Over there was Pasil, cloaked in purgatorial haze.  And here we were, atop a commercial ziggurat owned by the same billionaire who had built a slew of others.  
            Between the two, there was a gap as wide as ignorance itself and as deep, arguably, as destiny.</p>
          <p>Yet part of Cebu’s virtue was its stoicism in the midst of struggle, its bee-hive dynamism.  There was no denying the progress its people had made despite the 
            forlorn poverty.  Cranes and high-rises etched the sky like bars on a chart.  The roads I traversed as a young man—Jones Avenue, Colon Street, South Expressway—had 
            so thickened with trade that the quaint lawns and iron fences along them had all been pulverized into the foundations of condominiums and warehouses.   Something 
            about the city must be attracting the hordes of Japanese retirees and Korean businessmen and German pensioners.</p>
          <p>Yes, Cebu had moved on since I bade farewell in 1988.  I and Gus and the rest of our company did the same.</p>
          <p>We met up with Adrian and Mama at Ayala Mall, owned by the Ayala clan.  We had lunch at Sunburst Fried Chicken Restaurant, and at the end of our meal, there it was: 
            possibly the thing we were hunting.  Would it be better than the others we had had?  If so, would it be the best ever?</p>
          <p>Andy, whose turn it was to pay the tab, scooped the first purple spoonful from the chalice.  Michael gazed at the halo-halo expectantly, with the lust of an 
            alchemist.  In her head, Virginia counted her Weight Watchers points with dismay.  Liz feigned indifference—her initial approach to upcoming competition.  I 
            was finishing the last of my dark meat.</p>
          <p>The consensus, when the feeding frenzy was over, was that this halo-halo was only so-so.  And so our search continued.</p>
          <p>We took our two vehicles up to the Taoist Temple in Beverly Hills.  I hadn’t been there since, what, the early Tang Dynasty?  All the remembered sites of my 
            youth were clamoring to be seen and touched again, to be verified as though they were courtroom exhibits.  The temple was there all right, guarded gaudily by 
            red and yellow dragons, incense signaling its serenity.  The temple was set on a hillside, full of steps and tiers and terraces.  Stone rails and curved roofs 
            chased after each other, upward, until at the topmost balcony, we came to a gate overlooking some rich guy’s garage, laundry hanging on a clothesline.  Beverly 
            Hills was an exclusive community, but it wasn’t shy about showing its drying laundry.  Near the equator, the sun was law, and high.</p>
          <p>Around this time, I received an email on Virginia’s iPad.  The sender was Colton Faverty.  Colton and I had been communicating since before this trip began.  
            His email confirmed our plan.  I would send a driver to fetch him and his wife at four p.m. tomorrow, Sunday, from his hotel in Danao City.  At the moment, 
            Colton and his companions were in the town of Bogo, farther north, busy with their evangelistic work.  But on Sunday they would be returning to their base in 
            Danao, and there my driver would pick him up, with his wife, and drive them to Cebu to meet my family.</p>  
          <p>I was gladdened by the email, one of many Colton and I had been exchanging as we devised our plan.  Returning her iPad, I said to my wife, “It’s all set.  We’ll 
            see them tomorrow night at Ariston’s party.”</p>  
          <p>“Good,” said Virginia absent-mindedly.  To her, Colton was just a name.  To me, he was a kinsman.</p>
          <p>Next stop that Saturday: the cemetery where my dad and brother Arnold (son number three) were buried.  Getting there took forever as usual.  Traffic went from 
            bad to worse to normal without any perceptible difference.  Nearly two hours to go visit the dead, who didn’t mind waiting.</p> 
          <p>My paternal grandparents’ tombs lay in the same cemetery, Manila Memorial Park, in the town of Liloan.  I had visited my brother’s tomb in 2012.  But my father 
            had passed away some weeks after I returned to the States, and I could not attend his funeral.  Standing by his grave, I was reflective and solemn, and the 
            memories flowed easily.  Dad had had a stroke in 1987, one year before I left for America.  After his stroke, my dad refused to take his physical rehabilitation 
            seriously, or else simply surrendered to his debilitation.  His speech faltered, his limbs deteriorated, and in the last decade of his life, my father was 
            bed-ridden.  He and I had no meaningful relationship.  On my rare visits to Cebu, Papa and I would share a few contemplative minutes together, I in a chair, 
            he in his bed.  All we had to work with in those moments was our physical proximity.  All we had to go by were our mutual remembrances.  When I had been younger 
            and he healthier, we did have a relationship, a tense but mostly untroubled one.  He was a Chinese father, one with high “Chinese” expectations of me.  I had no 
            wish to be a “Chinese” son and heir, with all the obligations that that entailed.  I looked Chinese, but that was as far as it went.  This led to a volatile state 
            of affairs.  If head-butting meant we had a relationship, then you could say Papa and I were close.  His ill temper lives on in me; his way with money, even his 
            fondness for talk radio, he imparted to me.  All my recollections and emotions, beside that grave, came to me in an instant, fully formed, unnebulous and, saddest 
            of all, final.</p>
          <p>The lot of us loitered about, shifting awkwardly in death’s presence, which is an inversion of everything humans hold dear, an overt absence.  We can ignore death; 
            it won’t ignore us.  So we employ our rituals to mitigate the absence, endow it somehow with substance.  Mama was brushing off some leaves from Arnold’s grave.  
            Arnold had died too early, one day past his forty-third birthday, shocking us into speechlessness.  Around us everything was peaceful, though an air of vacancy, 
            a natural fragrance, hung over the cemetery.</p>    
         <p>On our way home, I asked Gus to stop at Padma’s house so I could say hello.  Padma was my best friend in college.  We were in theater and radio together, two 
           creative types from upper-income families.  We both taught.  We ate dim sum with equal relish and with lots of duck sauce.  I had rejected my Chinese identity, 
           consisting of millennia-old mores, and she resented the strictures of Hindu culture.  She admired my vocabulary, and I enjoyed her irrepressible optimism.  Padma 
           thought I was a crank, a Yankee reincarnated as a Chinaman.  I kidded her about her impatience with reading.  People assumed we were in love, but our relationship 
           was altogether Platonic.  At her house that evening, we hugged.  Yet I could not stay long, and Padma was busy.  Her kids were leaving for the airport that very hour.  
           Elmo, her husband, had just left for a wedding.  Her brother Bebo was staying with her.  The sun had set.  Padma asked if we could get together another day.  But 
           though the sun would surely rise again, our tomorrows were booked solid.  People were depending on me, on her; agendas were either up in the air or else were etched 
           in stone.  Gus looked antsy, eager to get going, thinking of traffic.  Our meeting was adjourned; no minutes were taken.  In our youth, Padma and I had lingered over 
           our food, licking our chopsticks.  Middle-aged, we discovered that time wasn’t duck sauce, something we could request continually from an infinitely accommodating 
           waiter.  Time was that last yummy morsel stuck on your chopsticks; when it was gone, it was gone, and then the bill came.</p>
          <p>But at least I had said hello to Padma.</p>      
          <p>That was the seventh day.
