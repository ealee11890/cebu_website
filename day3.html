        <h3>Reboot</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b>
          <p>By the time we got through Philippine immigration, it was ten minutes past midnight.  The date on the arrival stamp in my passport read “July 19.”  
          Two days had gone by since we hopped in the taxi in West Chicago.  All we had done this whole time was sit and wait—airborne in cramped quarters, alternating with spacious terrestrial 
          surroundings—and now two days had vanished from our vacation!  I was impatient to get on with seeing my mother and brothers.</p>
          <p>We claimed our baggage and headed out into the humid night.  A crowd, among whom I could not discern a familiar face, stood between the sidewalk and the road.  Some minutes went 
            by before I spotted Adrian.</p>  
          <p>“Adrian!” I yelled.  Adrian had a way of being always the first brother I saw on my infrequent visits to Cebu, his face utterly guileless, his heart fully accepting of me.  
            Adrian was the sixth among eight siblings.  An unfortunate prolonged stay in the hospital after his birth left him with compromised cognitive skills.  He was, as the euphemism goes, 
            “slow.”  But this very slowness, which gave his speech and actions a deliberate quality, obliged one to respond to Adrian in a similarly unhurried way, and somehow a pace was set 
            which elevated the interaction.</p>
          <p>He saw me; we hugged.  Adrian looked flabbergasted, so rare a sight was I in those parts.  “Where’s Mom?” I asked.  Adrian pointed to a beige van.  I walked over, and the van’s 
            door slid open, and there in the back seat was my mother, whom I had not seen in four years. </p>
          <p>“Hi, Mom!” I exclaimed, and across the chasm of four years all she said—all she needed 
            to say to me—was: “Alex.”  A quiet greeting, a recognition, a verdict, and a summary of my long absence, all in that one name.  But she smiled.</p>
          <p>The next moments were a blur.  Introductions were made and awkward nods thrown into the relational abyss, from the bottom of which, we all hoped, some comforting sound would return.</p>
          <p>Andy and Michael wound up riding in the beige van.  Liz and Virginia and I rode with my brother Gus, son number two, who had pulled up in his own vehicle.  Off we went, leaving 
            Mactan International Airport, crossing the bridge that spanned the channel, heading toward Cebu City.</p>
          <p>Each time I returned, this place was less and less recognizable to me.  Years ago, it had ceased to be the city with a small-town feel, the one I grew up in.  “The Queen of the 
            South,” as Cebu was known then: gracious, simple in taste, demure, nothing like brawling, bodacious Manila.  Now the Queen had aged, had developed an edge, inevitably expanding 
            in the middle.</p>
          <p>The streets were dark, but I saw enough of the stalls that lined the thoroughfares.   Behind the stalls stood the regular storefronts, crazy with signs and posters.  One could 
            tell that, though empty then, the buildings were accustomed to manic commerce during the day.  As Gus’s dashboard GPS gave its directions, I studied the streets, thick with 
            tangled wires and cables overhead, and intersected by anonymous alleys.  I was aghast and impressed at the same time.  It was a mystery how anything worked.  Or maybe I was too 
            dumb, too uninitiated, to understand.  I had left her in 1988.  Cebu had moved on.</p>
          <p>We turned into a road marked with an arrow and a sign that said “Newtown Estates.”  We went through a gate manned by a security guard, who saluted as he yawned.  We passed narrow 
            streets named “Wyoming,” “New York,” and “Illinois.”  Time zones were one thing, but a twilight zone?</p> 
          <p>Surreality set in, but no matter: we were home—my mother’s home on Kansas Street.</p>
          <p>A maid opened the gate to the carport, amid much barking by dogs on all sides.  In caninese, the mutts were proclaiming, “Number One Lee Son has arrived!  He has brought his family 
            with him at last—after a quarter of a century!”  I was giddy with the novelty of it all, drenched in sweat and drippy with happiness, which the dogs had sensed from their cages.</p>  
          <p>My mother’s driver and the maid brought in our luggage while I looked around, dazed and dazzled.  Vases and cushions dating from my school days lay about the house.  Framed 
            photographs, some in collages, were everywhere, like wares in a bazaar.  We milled about—my family, my mom, Adrian and Gus—making small talk, confident now that the relational abyss 
            we felt at the airport had narrowed to a manageable pit, not bad for half a night’s work.  Then a few of us went upstairs to take showers, and soon everyone was in bed, in 
            air-conditioned comfort, and stretched out—finally, blissfully horizontal.</p>  
          <p>In the morning, breakfast was waiting for us.  Some local elves, or the maid, had set fruit, jam, bread, instant coffee, bacon, spam, fried eggs and fried plantain on the dining 
            table, along with napkins, plates and utensils.  We ate with gusto, in shifts, my mom hovering over the table like a supervisor with a deadline.  Nothing gave my mom more pleasure 
            than to see her children eating well, and we, obedient offspring, obliged her.  When we were done, we left the table, taking our dirty plates and utensils to the kitchen sink.  
            But the maid stopped us, shocked, and motioned that we needn’t do such a thing.  On some days, respectful of custom, we rose from our meal like aristocrats, simply assuming our 
            leftovers and dishes would properly disappear.  On other days, guilt impelled us to deposit those dishes in the sink, especially when we saw, on the stove and cutting board, 
            preparations the maid was already making for our next meal.</p>
          <p>Her name was Ana Lynn.  As my mom’s servant, she cooked, did the laundry, cleaned the house, tended the garden, and fed the dogs.  Her week’s wages amounted to less than two 
            hours of mine at the United States post office.  Even with free room and board, it was not much to live on.  But that was the reality of it, culture and economics conspiring to 
            make life patently “unfair.”</p>
          <p>We left Anna Lynn a large tip at the end of our stay, along with a large, colorful Vera Bradley tote bag.  Our gratitude was genuine, but our gesture did little to ease the 
            injustice of her circumstances.</p>
          <p>I went up to my mom’s bedroom, and offered her a kiss along with my gifts: a can of dill-flavored peanuts, Jelly Belly candies, and a wad of cash.  She gave me a Seiko watch, 
            and pressed me to take her dog-eared volume on the history of the Illuminati and the Jesuits, whom she believed to be the Papacy’s Ringwraiths.  I accepted both, though I had been 
            in my youth Jesuit-educated, and despite my owning three other wristwatches already.  My mother loves God thoroughly and loathes the Devil, but over the years her wariness had 
            seeped into the conspiracist crevices of her daily routine.  She saw nefarious overtones in the U.S. dollar’s market gyrations, in the Vatican’s art collection, and in the 
            Starbucks corporate logo.  Only time would tell how well-founded my mom’s quirkier beliefs were.  But when she admonished me not to write any more opinion letters about Barack 
            Obama, lest I get arrested or, worse, recruited by “them,” I changed the subject.</p>
          <p>“So what’s your favorite Jelly Belly flavor?” I asked her.</p>
          <p>Late that morning, my brother Andrew (son number five) and his wife Monette came by.  We proffered and accepted each other’s pasalubong presents.  Introductions were made, 
            pleasantries exchanged, more food consumed.  Needing to get some new SIM cards for our cell phones, we headed for Ayala Mall, where we had lunch at Majestic Restaurant.  Gus 
            showed up, taking time off from an architects’ conference to be our chauffer.  Son number four, my brother Ariston, also joined us, and all of us had a swell time conversing, 
            sometimes with ponderous gravity, and at other times quite emptily.  We were strangers, by and large, learning to become relatives again.  The learning curve was uneven, but 
            steadily we became close, our progress helped by excellent Chinese cuisine.  Afterwards, we shopped.  Andrew and Monette had to leave in order to pick up their daughters from school.  
            Ariston returned to his office.  The rest of us went on a sight-seeing tour of Fort San Pedro, an historic Spanish fortification near the waterfront; Magellan’s Cross, housed in 
            its airy mausoleum; and Santo Nino Church, a larger, more resplendent mausoleum of sorts, containing a waxen facsimile of the dead Christ, its feet rubbed to gleaming smoothness 
            by a million pious hands.</p>
          <p>The afternoon was wet, about the only time it rained during our entire visit, which was smack dab in the middle of the rainy season.  I could not recall saying prayers to a 
            particular saint, but the demigods on the Catholic pantheon in charge of weather and international travel must have smiled favorably on us.</p>  
          <p>Later that evening, when they rejoined us, Andrew and Monette with their girls Hannah and Bianca in tow, and Ariston with his wife Joy in hand, we had dinner at Kuya J’s, a 
            Filipino fusion restaurant.</p>
          <p>Filipino food with a modern twist was not to my liking.  I prefer my native dishes crispy or gooey, with no multiculturalism or culinary experimentation to spoil the flavor and 
            texture.  The one big hit of the evening was the halo-halo, a dessert constructed of shaved ice and ube ice cream, set over a copious mix of sweet beans, young coconut and gelatin.  
            A sprinkling of cereal is laid over the ice cream, and a roll of vanilla wafer, almost as an accessory, is inserted into the concoction, beside a cube of golden flan.  The dessert, 
            in a bowl, practically dares you to mush it up.  Michael, a native of Iowa and all-Caucasian, was wide-eyed with wonder.  And when my mother said, “Go ahead, Michael—mix it up and 
            eat,” Michael went from wide-eyed to wild-eyed, and at that moment we knew that he was permanently part of our clan.
