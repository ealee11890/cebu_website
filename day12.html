        <h3>Mother's Day</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b><p>It rained before dawn on Thursday, but the rain was brief.  Several times during the last week, a minutes-long downpour would break over 
          the city while it slept.  Whatever front was coming in from the sea, causing the precipitation, blew in like clockwork.  It chimed thunderously four times before 
          dissipating.  The rain left the city awash in puddles, which quickly evaporated.  By breakfast, everything was dry again, albeit smelling of damp growth.  Except 
          for that afternoon at Fort San Pedro and Magellan’s Cross, it never rained while we were out.</p>
     <p>We had no itinerary that day; the plan was simply to spend time with Mama and Adrian.  We gave Ana Lynn her tip and the bag, which she received shyly.  When the dishes 
          were cleared, we played numerous rounds of Flash, a game using an inordinate number of dice.  Afterwards, I went up to Mama’s room, and spoke to her of 
          inconsequential subjects, the conversational equivalent of chips and nuts and candy—something to chew while we communicated a deeper truth to each other; namely, 
          that we loved each other, despite not having much of any importance to articulate, and despite years of separation.  Discussing dad’s life and illness and death, 
          or Arnold’s untimely demise, or my candor in matters of politics, or her theories concerning the Illuminati would have amounted to a futile rehashing of views and 
          ancient history.  We each knew where the other stood on issues.</p>  
     <p>“The main thing is,” Mama emphasized from her swivel chair, “your walk with the Lord.  Always trust in Jesus.  And He will never, never fail you.”</p>
     <p>I agreed.  She had told me so countless times, and countless times in response I had acknowledged the truth of her exhortation.  More and more, however, I felt that her 
          exhortations, so often repeated, were more than just friendly reminders; they sounded like a prophet’s warning—revival-meeting altar calls—replays of sermons on the 
          mount.</p>
     <p>“And stop writing about politics,” Mama advised me yet again.  “It’s dangerous and meaningless.”</p>
     <p>Well, she had a point about the meaninglessness of the exercise.</p>
     <p>Her bedroom walls, like the living room downstairs, were covered from floor to ceiling with family photographs.  Decoratively it was a mess.  But taken as a metaphor of 
          the cosmos—like Borges’ Aleph, the geometric point containing all other points; or his Library of Babel, an impossible depository of every compendium ever 
          conceived—Mama’s bedroom was nothing short of fantastic.  From every possible angle, every moment of Mama’s life was chronicled—captured—in those pictures: 
          her sons and daughter and their children, her parents, her husband and his parents, her brother and sister and half-siblings and cousins—the totality of her 
          world.  In the center of that world lay Mama’s bed, and on the bed, her Bible.</p>
     <p>“Here,” Mama said, lifting a stack of clothes from her closet.  “Take these shirts with you.”</p>
     <p>“I don’t need any more shirts.”</p>
     <p>“You wear them na—they’ll make you look younger.”</p>    
     <p>“I don’t care if I don’t look younger,” I rejoined.</p>
     <p>“And when you walk, don’t be so in a hurry.”</p>
     <p>“But I’m always in a hurry—it’s how I move.”</p>
     <p>“Oh, this boy!” she told her bedroom wall.  And somewhere on that wall, for sure, were two dozen photographs of me as a lad.</p>
     <p>Downstairs, Liz announced she wanted to go for a walk around the neighborhood, and invited everyone to join her.  We all trooped out, including Adrian, leaving Mama and 
          the maid in the house.  The dogs, cooped up in their cage, began barking in earnest as we opened the gate.  We marched down our street, and scouted the neighborhood 
          block by block.  It was a nice subdivision, the homes well-kept and the curb free of trash.  Bougainvillea dripped down from balconies, and in every nook and cranny 
          some green-thumbed fairy had installed pots of flowers.  Yet all the residences hid behind gated walls—so much insulated, standoffish charm.  In that climate, plants 
          thrived while wood deteriorated; the verdure so overpowering it became oppressive.  I had nearly forgotten what it was like to live with greenery all year round, 
          with no change in season, no falling leaves, no heaving frost, no buds straining to flower, no inkling of the grand passage of time.  Inertia punctuated by the 
          monsoon—that was the meteorological calendar of the Philippines.  It was one way of looking at life.  It was attractive in its simplicity, and problematic in the 
          ennui it engendered.  It made me sweat.</p>
     <p>I could not, in Cebu, imagine doing anything outside that required manipulating a tool.  Merely breathing would have sapped my strength.  How had I, in high school, 
          played basketball in the midday sun?  Shot hoops with mad dogs and Englishmen?  And how had that same lad, so accustomed to perspiring buckets, found the will and 
          fortitude to brave a blizzard in another zip code?</p>  
     <p>Was I too old to learn new tricks?  But being old brings with it a pension.  And with that pension would come a rocking chair.  That was possibly my ticket to ride—a 
          wheelchair, that is, toward the sunset of my golden years.</p>
     <p>We doubled back to the house.</p>
     <p>“Which one was your favorite, Liz?” I prodded my daughter, the architecture graduate.</p>
     <p>“The one with the iron grillwork on its windows,” Liz allowed.</p>
     <p>Andy said, “I liked the house with the roof of different colors.”</p>
     <p>“Stick to engineering, Andy,” said Liz, ever the older sister.</p>
     <p>We had lunch, mostly leftovers.  Afterwards, we watched a documentary about Bruce Lee, consisting mainly of tedious interviews and overwrought action footage.  In the 
          middle of it, I left to pack my suitcases.  Our flight out was at 11:55 that night; I could hardly believe it.</p>
     <p>When the disc was finished, we all gathered in Mama’s room.  Liz and Andy and Michael and Virginia and Adrian and I, standing before Mama in her swivel chair, sang “Happy 
          Birthday” to her.  She would be 79 in a week or so.  I gave her a card and a present, and then we took turns giving her a kiss.  Mama was pleased.  I was equally 
          pleased to have been there; to have participated at last, after so long, in a significant family event.</p>
     <p>Gus arrived later that afternoon, and played Flash with us.  In an hour Adrian and Andy rode with him to a restaurant in Mactan, our rendezvous point, mere minutes from 
          the airport.  The rest of us followed in Mama’s van, with our luggage in the back.</p>  
     <p>11:55 that night; I could hardly believe it.  Hadn’t we just flown in yesterday?</p> 
     <p>The restaurant was called “Fabulous Fifties Cafe.”  We arrived right after Gus had, followed by Andrew and Ariston in their own vehicles, accompanied by their families.  
          The waiters shoved two tables together, and on that long table we had our last supper in Cebu.  It was not, however, a somber time.  Everyone was jovial, though one 
          or two of the teenagers did get drawn to their luminous little hand-held screens, the online universe apparently more engaging than an American-fifties-themed 
          restaurant full of antiques and flea-market treasures.  There was abundant food before us, Filipino and Chinese dishes—even pizza, in honor of the Illinoisans 
          present.  The beer flowed—flavored and regular San Miguel; soda for anyone who preferred it.  Halo-halo was ordered and consumed without much ado.  We had become 
          veterans as far as halo-halo was concerned, not jaded but certainly matter-of-fact about its merits.  We had found our holy grail, and had promptly stored it in 
          the china cabinet.  Maybe it was time to leave the country.</p>
     <p>Folks talked across the length and width of our table, interacting randomly, their voices rising as the music from the band grew loud, and lowering as it subsided.  
          The cousins enquired of one another regarding life in the Philippines and life in America, comparing notes and extrapolating their dreams.  Then the young people 
          would turn and converse with the adults, lumping gossip and whining and serious dialogue in torrents of words which converged, at our table, into a river log-jammed 
          with aspirations and insecurities.</p>
     <p>The river came to a stop at a quarter to ten.  We had to go.  Our flight on Asiana Airlines was leaving in two hours.  We paid up, and took the stairs down to the parking 
          lot.</p>   
     <p>The scene at the airport was quintessential departure-terminal drama.  Our luggage was set on the ground in a final act of irreversibility.  This was followed by much 
          hugging and kissing and shaking of hands.  There were so many of us that a minor melee ensued.  I lost track of whom I had bade farewell to, and whom I had not.  
          Hours later I realized I had neglected to kiss Mama goodbye, and a pang of guilt struck my heart, and shame burnt my cheeks and, in the midst of my discomfiture, 
          my conscience—straight into my eardrums— yelled, “You IDIOT!”</p> 
     <p>It had been an understandable oversight, but it cast a gloom over the flight to Seoul.  I’ll email her when I get home, I decided.  I’ll call her on the phone.  She 
          knows I love her.  Maybe she didn’t notice.</p> 
     <p>“You heartless IDIOT!”</p> 
     <p>When the superego gets going, it is unrelenting.</p>
     <p>Our relatives were still waving at us as we entered the terminal, and then we had to get in line in front of the airline counter.  And just like that, it was just the 
          five of us again, with our passports and luggage and leftover Philippine currency.</p>
     <p>We checked in our suitcases, and went through security, and found our gate, and sat and waited.  Mactan Airport had been modernized since the last time I had flown out 
          of there.  Plate glass and bright lights and cold air now abounded, instead of the decrepit-hangar ambience which pervaded it back then.  By and large, things were 
          moving in the right direction in Cebu.  Rome hadn’t been built in a day, and if the World Bank had existed in ancient times, Rome likely would never have been built, 
          not without crushing debt.  You take what you can get.</p>   
     <p>When the time came to board, we lined up once more, the five of us sandwiched in the middle of a column of Koreans in beach wear.  The Filipina airport employees 
          graciously checked our tickets, and waved us through.  I was exhausted.  Next thing I knew, we were in the cabin.  The overhead bins were slammed shut, the 
          “fasten seatbelt” light came on, and the plane began to taxi.  I peered out the window and saw, or thought I saw—shoulder to shoulder on the tarmac, their 
          smiles glistening in the dark—all forty-eight security guards we had seen or met in Cebu.
