        <h3>Chasing Tomorrow</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b><p>We flew out of O'Hare on a Sunday, the five of us sitting straight across near the wings of the Delta Airlines jetliner, all my eggs in one basket. 
          If that basket should crash, it would be the end of my genetic legacy; my wife, my son, daughter, son-in- law, and I pouring our collective gene pool down the drain,
          into the Great Lakes or the Sea of Japan. But as the statisticians say, we have a better chance of dying at a bus stop on Chicago's South Side than at 35,000 feet 
          in the stratosphere. Also, according to the same saps, we can drown in water with an average depth of three inches. In any case, the flight attendant had said that 
          any sort of mishap was an "unlikely event," so I took comfort in the malleability of words.</p>
        <p>It was the seventeenth of July, 2016, and we were on our way to Cebu City, in the Philippines, to visit my mother, my brothers and their families. 
          I had been there in 2012 to be at my father's deathbed. The last time the rest of my family had visited Cebu, my daughter Elizabeth was two years old, 
          and my son Andy was one. Now they were twenty-six and twenty-four, biracial still, as they had been back then. Of course my wife Virginia and I were correspondingly 
          older. Yes, say the actuaries, people can die of old age too, barring any plane crashes.</p>
        <p>Michael, Elizabeth's husband, was traveling with us. He had never been to the Philippines, though he had flown to eighteen other countries, give or take a layover. 
          Michael, not only a perfect husband, was also a pleasant companion, always ready with a wry smile and, when pressed, a diplomatic opinion. Now the five of us were 
          hurtling through the air at 590 miles an hour, on a mission to rekindle relationships, and consume, along the way, our share of queer confections, there, on the other 
          side of the globe.</p>
        <p>The Philippines is thirteen hours ahead of Chicago. It is tomorrow there today, and so we had a lot of catching up to do. International air travel, when done right, 
          is a matter of watching four movies in quick succession while ripping the cellophane from the tray of comestibles the stewardesses hand you every five hours; 
          wolfing the food down without spilling it; minimizing your trips to the lavatory, and then timing those trips to avoid standing conspicuously near the door; and lastly, 
          sleeping spasmodically. A Zen-like control of one's bodily functions is an advantage. Some passengers, like bears, hibernate in the cabin, curling up beneath their 
          thin blankets sans nutrition and human interaction. By contrast, parents of young children spend their whole time awake, tending to crying babies or fidgety toddlers. 
          These parents tend not to watch movies on the flight, and are more inclined to eye the aircraft's emergency exit with desperate longing.</p>
        <p>An hour out of Chicago, we landed in Detroit. We took up temporary residence inside Metropolitan Airport, whose gates were serviced by several trams, hugging the 
          ceiling of the barn-like terminal like a family of sleek, sneaky rodents. I whiled away three hours in Detroit by reading a history of the Great Depression, 
          The Forgotten Man, by Amity Shlaes. By the time our connecting flight began boarding, my dislike for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hatched years ago, had grown markedly.</p> 
        <p>Liz and Michael and Andy put away their electronic devices; Virginia bade her Facebook friends goodbye and shut her iPad; I threw my analog paperback into my carry-on, and we joined the queue at
          the gate. That was the last time any of us was able to stand straight for any length of time. In the next twelve hours, we would be permanently and claustrophobically 
          seated-slumped, stiff-necked, and semi-conscious. Dim, silent figures fed us regularly and offered juice, coffee or tea. Slaves on a galley: we felt like well-heeled 
          refugees, with a selection of recent cinematic releases at our fingertips, plus video games and TV shows and recorded music of every possible genre ready to play at 
          the merest touch of a screen. And if nothing else proved suitable-there was sleep. "To die, to sleep... to sleep, perchance to dream," as Hamlet enunciated, and as the 
          line of Shakespeare reverberated dully in my head (or was it our pilot making an announcement?), we found ourselves approaching Seoul, South Korea.</p>
        <p>Four more hours of flying to go.</p>
        <p>But first we had to land, and continue our interminable sitting and waiting. Sitting and staring. Shifting and stretching-luxuries after our long encapsulation over 
          the Arctic Circle.</p>
        <p>Shops at airports all look the same. There's your souvenir shop, coffee shop, the gourmet candies store, a couple of fast-food restaurants and the requisite perfumery. 
          The shops have a uniformly sterilegloss to them. And only at an airport can the humblest hotdog be marketed as a gourmet dish, and be priced accordingly. Well, at 
          Wrigley Field too, but I digress.</p>
        <p>Though I had seen them many times before, I was freshly impressed by the numerous gates around me, each with a different advertised destination: Hong Kong... Abu 
          Dhabi... Taipei. It struck me that, notwithstanding the many hours of flying we had just endured, it truly was a small world after all. The planet was practically a 
          single, glassed-in neighborhood, and I happened to be sitting on a curb one block from Bombay, two away from Shanghai, and a moving walkway removed from Sydney. 
          I could literally have gone up to a counter, shown my barcoded piece of paper to an employee, swept through the gate, taken a seat, taken a nap, taken a leak, and 
          have reemerged in a city that spoke neither English nor Korean. The airport was a microcosm of humanity. Could global peace be far behind?</p>
        <p>I glanced at a TV screen nearby, and listened to what CNN had to say about peace. CNN had no idea what it meant.</p>
        <p>But all that thinking made me hungry, so I found a fast-food place, and imagined eating a hotdog. Liz and Michael, when I returned, were in fact sharing a 
          hamburger. The fries, I observed, were all gone, probably squirreled away in a repurposed barf bag. Andy lay sprawled beside a charging station, his smart phone 
          getting all the juice it needed to receive Natalie's text messages, Natalie being Andy's girlfriend who, though she was at that moment in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
          was snuggling with Andy in Seoul and spirit.</p>
        <p>Virginia was nowhere to be found, which meant she was likely getting her 10,000 steps in, part of her daily exercise. Somewhere near Shanghai, if I had my gate 
          geography right, was where she was briskly and aimlessly walking.</p>
        <p>At 6:05 p.m., we boarded our flight, and Asiana Airlines flew us to Cebu in the span of one full meal and a snack.</p></b>
