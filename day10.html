        <h3>Plantation Bay</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b>
          <p>Coming downstairs the next morning, I was greeted with the usual cheery bombast of Christian music blaring from Mama’s living-room radio.  Mama liked to fill 
            her house with the right spirit.  Sometimes, at night, Adrian would watch the news on TV.  There the usual gang of government thieves—Manila politicians—would 
            air their positions on issues and their schemes for bettering the country, the end result of which, in my experience growing up, was always a fatter bank account 
            for them.  The national government, like a perpetual tropical depression, roiled and steamed, threatening to bring rain and calamity to the rest of the nation.  
            Watching the news on politics was the same as watching the weather report: whatever was in store for the rest of the country was coming for it sooner or later.  
            I had seen on television the new president, Rodrigo Duterte, giving a speech to the legislative assembly.  His style and agenda were a breath of fresh air, but 
            there was no telling when that zephyr would turn into a typhoon.</p>
     <p>Long ago, my mom had decided to dispense with that hullabaloo, and stick to the Bible—its commandments and revelations and promises.  The Christian music in her house, 
            turned up full-volume, was Mama’s way of creating a force field around the premises, impervious to the deceit of the fallen world.  I turned the radio down to 
            normal volume, only to hear my stomach growling.</p>
     <p>Coffee and toast helped to settle my digestion.  Adrian came up from his bedroom in the basement, and we chatted.  Then everyone else filed downstairs, and enjoyed the 
            breakfast which I could not touch: fried plantains, slices of spam, rolls, pickled sandwich spread, ripening fruit, last night’s torta and the kalamay—thick 
            peanuty molasses—which I had purchased in Bohol.</p>  
     <p>Later, checking my email, I learned that Colton and Peta and their outreach team would not be in Lapu-Lapu City this week after all.  From my last conversation with 
            Colton, amid the din at Ariston’s dinner party, I had thought that they might be, and had held out hope that we might still meet.  I was keen on introducing 
            Colton to Liz and Michael, since all three of them had been in missions.  Michael and Elizabeth, before they got engaged, had spent a year in Orlando, Florida, 
            working at Campus Crusade headquarters.  That year, they had flown all over the world, producing audio for the Jesus film in the particular language of the 
            territory to which they were assigned.</p>  
     <p>But the meeting was not to be.  Today and tomorrow, my family would be near Lapu-Lapu City in Mactan, but Colton’s crew would not be there until the following week.  
            They remained up north, presenting the message of the Gospel to local schools.  
     <p>God must have a plan, I concluded.  I considered turning up my mom’s radio, as a protest—a plea—a desperate ploy.  I felt badly for my “dad” Ray, who had also been 
            eager to have everyone make each other’s acquaintance.  Finally, resigned to the failure, I got ready for Plantation Bay Resort, and instructed everyone to 
            do the same.</p>
     <p>Mama rode with us.  Our driver took us through the rush-hour jam, which was only a little less sticky than Cebu’s midday bottlenecks.  We passed my old high school 
            on Mango Avenue, Sacred Heart School (for boys, the Blue Eagles).  Whatever the Jesuits’ plans may be with regards to world domination, they taught me to read 
            and to love reading.  In elementary school, I learned about Dick and Jane and their dog Spot.  Later I followed the adventures of Tarzan and Tom Swift.  I fed 
            on volumes of the Hardy Boys series before sinking my teeth into O. Henry and the classics, into non-fiction and poetry.  In college, I read Borges and Garcia 
            Marquez and Updike and C. S. Lewis.  I read novels by Stephen King which today, after a diet of E. L. Doctorow and Mary Renault and Anthony Burgess, I would not 
            be able to stomach after one chapter.</p>
     <p>The Jesuits and their faculty taught me to write well.  In Oregon, during my year as an exchange student, I wrote a short story for my high-school English class.  My 
            teacher, Mr. Manuel, read the paper aloud in class and asked me, when he had finished, whether I had been educated by Jesuit priests.  “Yes,” I admitted, 
            impressed with his forensic acumen.</p>
     <p>“I can tell by the structure of your story,” Mr. Manuel explained.  “It has a beginning, a middle, and an end—conflict and resolution, followed by a denouement.”</p>
     <p>A Jesuit education laid down in me a stratum of good soil which, enriched by a tincture of American public-school irreverence, allowed sturdy and attractive ideational 
            plants to grow as I matured.  I confess there have been a few intractable weeds as well.</p>
     <p>Jesuits taught me how to wield logic as a scalpel, and how to employ the Socratic Method as a drain rod, clearing people of any silliness in their thinking.  None of 
            these skills, however, could overcome my wife’s use of God’s Word when she and I argued.  In the end I always lost, my joints separated from the marrow, on the 
            cutting board.</p>
     <p>If Jesuits were this good at molding young minds, then the world was theirs for the taking, notwithstanding my mother’s alarums.  But this world was, in any case, a 
            condemned world.  Colton and his team were in the countryside that very hour, attempting to save as many souls as possible from perishing in the coming judgment.  
            As testimony to life’s corruption, the plebian cemetery just down the road from Sacred Heart School came into view.  Its tombs, rough-cut and dark with weather 
            and age, were stacked five high like shipping containers.  Within the walls of this cemetery dwelt a permanent population of living humans, who had their own 
            produce market, tribunals, and festivals, all associated with the economy which their immense graveyard begat.  Chicago had its ethnic neighborhoods—Polish, 
            Puerto Rican, Vietnamese—and Cebu had this enclave, no less proud than any Chinatown, and every bit as self-sufficient in its isolation.  This was Pasil with 
            a morbid twist.  It didn’t seem right that we were passing it on our way to Plantation Bay, the region’s most expensive beach resort, where we would spend the 
            next twenty-four hours of our charmed lives.</p>
     <p>Near the wharf, traffic eased, and we were soon proceeding up Mactan Bridge, the same one we had crossed on our way from the airport last Tuesday, many moons and 
            memories ago.</p>  
     <p>We entered the city of Lapu-Lapu, named after the heroic ruler of Mactan, and found the road to the resort.  I was apprehensive about our hotel.  On Saturday, I 
            had called several mid-range hotels in Mactan, looking to reserve two rooms for Tuesday night.  Sometimes no one answered at the other end, and when someone 
            did, it was invariably to say that they had no vacancies.  As a rule, I refuse to pay much more than $100 for a hotel room, a policy born of frugality and 
            long experience with Days Inn franchises.  That Saturday morning, the only room available for Tuesday on the entire island of Mactan was a $500 family suite 
            at Plantation Bay Resort & Spa.  The lady who had taken my call had a sweet voice, but her tone implied that I could take it or leave it.</p>
     <p>“Splurge!” my impetuous side urged me.  “You only live once!  This makes up for that nasty motel you had your family stay in at Niagara Falls in 1999!”</p> 
     <p>The heckling in my head continued until my rational side, in a stroke of rationalization so deftly done as to be imperceptible, whispered in my ear: “There are five 
            of you.  That’s just a hundred dollars per person.  Look at it that way.”</p>
     <p>“Okay,” I told the kind lady on the phone.  “I’ll take it.”</p>
     <p>Twenty-three thousand pesos for one night’s lodging!  No breakfast included!  There had better be security guards at every cabana!</p> 
     <p>The road leading to Plantation Bay did not look promising.  It was dusty, and once through the gate (defended by a solitary guard), I saw that the driveway was 
            black-topped, not tiled in marble.  We bade goodbye to Mama, and sauntered up to the front desk.  Another girl with the same mellifluous voice took our 
            information.  I surveyed the entrance pavilion; it was clean and well-ventilated.  A bar stood on one corner, opposite a closet-size cage containing some 
            exotic birds.  Along one wall were arrayed several display cases offering overpriced souvenirs.  Lots of space.  Lots of Koreans and Japanese and Chinese.  
            I could tell them apart.  The Filipinos were dressed in five-star-hotel garb: starched uniforms for the front-line employees, and loose, monochromatic clothing 
            for the room- and grounds-maintenance personnel.</p>
     <p>Because check-in was at three o’clock and our rooms weren’t ready, the hotel took our bags for safe-keeping while we used its facilities.</p> 
     <p>We received our beach towels at a towel station, and found a couple of chaise longues.  The complex consisted of a sinuous central lagoon lined in concrete, surrounded 
            by two- and three-story plantation-style buildings.  The buildings were white and sat very close to the lagoon, separated from the water by a narrow stretch of 
            sand.  Some of the buildings stood over the water, so that a guest could have jumped directly into the pool from his balcony in order to avoid getting sand 
            between his toes.  Between the buildings were shops and restaurants, a game room, a spa, and various inviting kiosks.  The water in the lagoon was supplied 
            from the sea, filtered and consequently devoid of seaweed or any number of Neptune’s detritus and dandruff.  Because it was saltwater, it felt organic, free 
            of the heavy smell and taste of chlorine.  In any case, there were four discrete freshwater pools abutting the lagoon.  Palms and mangrove trees and climbing 
            plants flowering in the sun were in abundance.  There were two ponds, one stocked with fish, the other with live coral.   At the northern end of the property, 
            an artificial waterfall spilled ostentatiously into its concrete basin.  There were racks of bicycles for one’s use, as well as a private beach with a jetty 
            and water-sports equipment.  Did I mention the towel stations?</p>
     <p>Here, I was not tempted to pick up a counterfeit stone for my collection.</p>
     <p>The lounge chairs we claimed lay across from a diving platform.  We also claimed our complimentary drinks, and lathering ourselves with sunblock lotion, we waded into 
            the pool and disappeared into the warm, immaculate embrace of the water.</p>
     <p>There were perhaps two dozen other bathers besides the five of us, half of them children, and all of them either Korean or Japanese.  They were not there to get tanned, 
            judging by the spandex suits they wore, covering everything up to their neck and wrists and ankles.  Some of them had hats on, paddling on their rented kayaks.  
            We, by contrast, were easy to spot.  Liz and Virginia wore bathing suits, and the guys had on our swimming trunks.  On that day anyway, we were unafraid of 
            melanoma.</p>
     <p>The lagoon, in the shape of a papaya, was bisected by a thin isthmus, lined with chairs and umbrellas and thatched cottages.  It was not deep, except near the diving 
            platform and in a few other areas.  But it was large, perhaps the equivalent of seven Olympic-size pools.  This was to be our neighborhood for a day and a night.  
            Away from crowds and dust and stray dogs; away from quotidian concerns and the “tyranny of the urgent”; away from philosophic hand-wringing and political 
            head-bashing; away from Jesuits radical or mild; away from anything our filtered seawater could not cleanse.  Even tipping was disallowed.</p>  
     <p>The only question in our minds was:</p>
     <p>How was the halo-halo there?</p> 
     <p>We had lunch at Kilimanjaro Kafe, at the end of which we scored their halo-halo.</p>
     <p>Answer: Good, but not better than Majestic’s.</p>  
     <p>Three o’clock came.  We retrieved our bags, and were driven to our accommodations in a zippy little electric cart.  With no traffic jam restraining us, we sailed 
            through in less than a minute.  We were staying at “Zanzibar House,” next door to “Yucatan House,” and a gemstone’s throw from “Xanadu Lodge.”  Riding on in 
            the electric cart, we would have passed “Valhalla Hall,” “Tahiti House,” and a host of other esoterically designated edifices until, just after “Edo Hall,” 
            we would have returned to the entrance pavilion, the abode of practical humans whose business was to collect all payments due from mortal guests.</p>  
     <p>Nice arrangement.</p>   
     <p>But we got off at “Zanzibar,” and climbed the stairs to our rooms.  We knew upon opening the door that we were not, by any means, at a Days Inn motel.  The first thing 
            we saw was not a clunky air-conditioning unit half-hidden behind the drapes.  Our first view of the suite consisted of a wide, sun-drenched terrace, furnished 
            with tables, stands and chairs, floor lamps on either end of a couch, and ceiling fans ready to do battle with the heat.  Beyond the terrace’s railing was the 
            green splendor of the lagoon itself, basking under blue sky and fluffy clouds.  It was a million-dollar view purchased for 23,000 pesos.</p>  
     <p>On one side of the T-shaped terrace was the door to our bedroom; on the other, the door to Liz’s and Michael’s.  They had a king-size bed; we had two queens, one for 
            Virginia and me to share, the other for Andy.  Each chamber was air-conditioned, and came with its own ceiling fan.  Each opened out separately, via louvered 
            doors, onto the front of the terrace.  The linens were impeccable; the floor was made of hardwood; the hotel stationery was, along with all other paraphernalia, 
            perfectly in place.</p>
     <p>Entering the bathroom, I nearly gasped, for there, gleaming coolly, was my marble.  I forgave the hotel its asphalt driveway.  The bathroom’s fixtures were of brass or 
            chrome.  A shower stall and a tub competed for my attention, as though presenting a moral dilemma to all would-be bathers.  Towels were sumptuously folded; the 
            hair dryer hung self-consciously in its cradle, in a posture of indolence.  The mirror, wide as a mural, caught my reflection, and my reflection said to me: “You 
            don’t deserve this.  Admit it.”</p>   
     <p>Later that afternoon, when I was alone, a guest-relations employee knocked on the door, and offered me a gift basket, compliments of the manager.  I thanked him and laid 
            the basket, filled with fruit, chocolate and local delicacies, on a stand, my apprehension about Plantation Bay banished for good.  Virginia and the rest had gone 
            down to amuse themselves with the tandem bicycles.  I took a dip in the pool, and joined them afterwards in the game room.</p>
     <p>On our way to dinner at twilight, I saw that a wall encircled the perimeter of the complex.  Our path followed this wall, which must have been fifteen feet high, its 
            bulk apparent from the configuration of its base.  As we walked, the wall followed us.  Management must surely have trusted this barrier, for I had not espied 
            another security guard since that morning.  I suspected that the wall existed not simply to separate inside from outside, but to protect the inside from the 
            outside.  The movie King Kong came to mind, with its scenes of the giant ape pounding the hapless timber wall of the natives’ village, erected as a bulwark 
            against mystery and monstrous muscle.  That wall did not stand a chance against anthropoid rage.  What was our wall designed to repulse?  There were faint 
            cricket noises on the other side, nothing more.  A tarsier grown to freakish proportions—that had flattened the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, and now sought to 
            swim in our lagoon?  Was that what the wall awaited?</p>  
     <p>Were we in Camelot, haunted by our own idealism, while the larger world grappled with reality?</p>
     <p>Was Plantation Bay Resort a 24/7 mirage, an illusion so intense that nightfall could not dispel it?</p>
     <p>And why all the fancy place-names—Tahiti, Havana, Chenonceaux—attached to the resort’s buildings?  There were more towns represented around the lagoon than were 
            serviced by the airlines at Incheon International Airport.  But here one didn’t strap on a seat belt to go places; we strapped on, rather, our powers of 
            pretense, trekking through hemispheres and history on our way to dinner.</p>
     <p>We arrived at the Savannah Grill and Lounge, down the slope from where we had had lunch at the Kilimanjaro Kafe.  In addition to all the other amenities, the hotel’s 
            extravagant nightly rate included some terrific lessons in geography.</p>    
     <p>We had Italian food that night.  Afterwards, Liz spoiled herself at the spa.  Andy, on the terrace, talked or texted with Natalie until well past midnight.  Michael?  
            Waited for Liz, I suppose.  My tummy had recovered from its unease.  Virginia lay sleeping, her Slovak complexion blushed crimson from that day’s sessions in 
            the sun.  I finished my book.  A New History of the Great Depression, it said on the cover.  I understood better now the plight of the common man—the “forgotten 
            man” of the author’s thesis.  I apprehended the forces that tugged at him; the exploitation, by altruistic villains, of this man’s heroism and helplessness.  
            There was a line connecting Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.  It was a line that defaced the legacy of Calvin Coolidge.  There was another line which 
            curved from Roosevelt to Barack Obama, a great graffiti squiggle vandalizing Ronald Reagan’s visage in gaudy punk colors.  This line depicted the Left’s assault 
            on liberty and reason.  It was a line which snaked around the world, striking at the hearts of nations, and eventually, I feared, it would pierce the high wall 
            across our quiet building—a ramrod red with spilled blood and bureaucratism, pummeling all into submission with political correctness and extra-constitutional 
            edicts.</p>     
     <p>I put my book down and turned off the light.  Good night, Wall.
