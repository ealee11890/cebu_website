        <h3>Island-Hopping</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b>
          <p>Next morning, while everyone else snoozed, I had coffee on the terrace.  Dawn was breaking.  The lagoon below was flat as glass.  A few workers were raking 
            leaves.  I thought: This wouldn’t be a bad place to retire.  Six more years of paying Uncle Sam to waste my money, and I could take my savings and pension, and 
            run—run right into the water with a big splash.</p>  
     <p>But could I survive the rest of Cebu—the stultifying heat, the clinging humidity, the traffic as thick as kalamay?  Was I capable of mixing with the proletariat, 
            smelling it, smelling what it smelled, comprehending its privation?  Could I, in Kipling’s words, “walk with crowds”?  Or would retirement consist of swimming 
            round and round an existential fish bowl, one half of the bowl being this first-rate resort, and the other half a faraway mall?  What kind of life would that be?  
            Devoid of neighborhood parks, farmers’ markets and garage sales?  Not being able to stroll down a lane without fear of being crushed in a stampede?  Heat and 
            humidity were fine in August, but all year long?</p>
     <p>I recalled the fragrance of pine needles on my first day in Oregon.  I was fifteen; I had not known, until then, how dry air felt on the skin.  It felt alien and 
            exquisite.  And then it snowed one December day in 1975, the flakes falling like gifts from another world, my conception of a white Christmas materializing 
            like a magical snowman.</p>  
     <p>Fast forward to 2016: January in the Midwest, and I a letter-carrier, bundled up in layers of clothing— long johns, hand warmers, gloves, insulated overshoes, everything 
            in the winter catalogue—with eight hours of work in front of me, over icy pavement, under low clouds, and the wind chill at minus ten degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
     <p>I finished my coffee.  It wasn’t easy picking a retirement address.  Tropical warmth, or the tingly freshness of spring?  Low cost of living, or left-turn-only lanes?  
            Parent and brothers, or baby-sitting grandchildren?  Plentiful halo-halo, or over-the-counter cheesecake?</p> 
     <p>I dashed downstairs and jogged toward the cove on the other side of Plantation Bay, where the jetty was located.  I found a spot on the far end of the rocky quay, and 
            watched the sun rise, an orange and lavender spectacle framed by cirrus clouds and an azure sea.</p>
     <p>That—or the colors of autumn?</p>
     <p>Why not both?  Be a snow-bird, like some of my retired customers back in Illinois.  Winters near the equator; summers in the northern latitudes.  I would have to confer
            with Virginia of course.  That necessity threw some cold water on my daydream.  So I got up.  And, being already in my swimming trunks, I made my way to the 
            lagoon, kicked off my sandals, and entered the water, the lagoon a mammoth bathtub reserved exclusively for me, the water warmer than the last ounce of my coffee 
            at the terrace.  I swam to the center, near a volleyball net that had been strung over a shallow section of the pool.  I was alone, but birds had perched on the 
            net.  These were not iridescent or fancifully plumed—just little brown birds with red beaks, a flock of them wondering who the hell I was, some odd tourist 
            wearing no spandex suit, with the sun having risen.  Around me: the buildings of Plantation Bay, bleary-eyed, greeting their reflection on the liquid glass; 
            men raking sand, as though tending a rock garden, or sweeping the infield of a baseball diamond; a clear canopy of sky.  Lowering my head in the water, I shut 
            my eyes, unwilling to wake up from the dream.</p>  
     <p> I returned to the room, my family was still in bed.  I roused them.  Though check-out time was at noon, Gus was picking us up at eight-thirty that morning to go 
            island-hopping.  Everything had been arranged beforehand.  We grabbed, for breakfast, some of the remaining pastry in the gift basket; then we packed up, and 
            paid up at the front desk.  We hated to leave, with three hours remaining before our time was up at the hotel.  But we had no choice.  We bade adieu to 
            Chenonceaux and the man-made lagoon, and prepared to greet the sea itself.</p>
     <p>Adrian was with Gus.  They pulled up, and we hopped in.  We drove fifteen minutes, and arrived at our embarkation point.  A ramp led down to a long, large boat, 
            its outriggers spanning the water like featherless wings.  Virginia, sunburned, was relieved to see a canvas canopy flapping in the breeze.  We got on, assisted 
            by the three men who were the boat’s crew, and off we sailed into the mild blue yonder, the engine’s noise and the flapping canvas and the hull and outriggers 
            slicing the waves drowning our voices.  Onboard the ferry to Bohol, we had regarded the sea as a highway, something to use toward accomplishing an end.  We were 
            up on a steel deck, while the sea, with its saltiness and fish, was below us, carrying the ship even as the ship carried us.  But riding in our open boat was a 
            different experience.  From this boat, we did not see the sea so much as encounter it; the sea was an element, a force, a pal who did not know his own strength—a 
            pal who slapped you on the shoulder as a jest, but who, in a foul mood, could maul you to death without paying you much attention.  You enjoyed his company, but 
            feared getting too close.</p>
     <p>For an hour, we seven teased each other; meditated without attempting meditation.  We felt the spray—mimicking us as it teased our hair.  We felt the four winds whip 
            between our legs, out our pores, and around our very essence.  It was like riding a Harley, wet and wild, straight to hog heaven.</p>
     <p>In an hour, we reached Nalusuan, our first island.</p>
     <p>The thing about islands is their distinctness.  True, they all look alike, and the Philippines has over 7,000 of them.  But approach one from the sea, and that island 
            virtually soars out of the water, its shoulders the green and brown hills, the shore its white, upturned and welcoming palm.  “Come,” it says.  “Let me show you 
            my secret.  Other islands near or far or not yet born may resemble me, but I am not them.  Nor am I the sea, though it covers my body.  The sea nourishes me, yet 
            desires most of all to subdue me.  Dear stranger, I am here for you alone. ”  And you gaze about, and see other green and brown islands, but those are unknown to 
            you, while this island, beckoning with its beguiling secret, is in hand, one hop over the surf from becoming yours.</p>
     <p>Each island is unique because you can tread only one at any given moment.  You seize the day by seizing, as a pirate might, your island.</p>
     <p>Nalusuan lay many yards from our boat.  From its shore, a long, narrow wooden pier extended, and it was onto the end of this pier that we leaped, dive masks and goggles 
            in hand.  Descending into the water were concrete stairs, which we took, diving eagerly to meet the schools of colorful fish circling the coral.  We were immersed 
            in our own super aquarium, bags of fish food clutched in our fists.  Before us, fins darted to and fro, synchronized yet seeming to be haphazard, a choreography 
            only nature can perform.  The sun blazed through the sea’s surface, and lit the water into glorious transparency.  It was breathtaking—or would have been, had we 
            not been obliged to hold our breaths underwater.</p>  
     <p>We cavorted thus with the marine life, the fish and mollusks and crustaceans inhabiting the little reef, along with the worms and crabs and spiny and gelatinous creatures 
            half-hidden on the bottom. Presently we moved on, marching down the pier toward solid ground.  We came upon some cottages, clustered around a tree which shaded a 
            ping-pong table.  I myself cast no judgment on the presence of a ping-pong table in the middle of an island in the middle of nowhere.  The table seemed less 
            incongruous than a building named “Zanzibar” on the edge of an artificial lagoon.  The cottages were rented out to guests of the resort.  Indeed, the entire 
            island was a resort.  And if playing table tennis after a morning of snorkeling was a guest’s cup of tea, the resort was happy to oblige, at no extra charge.</p>
     <p>But Andy was perturbed by the ping-pong table.  “That thing doesn’t belong here,” he pronounced.  “It’s not regulation-size!”  He pointed to one corner of the table, 
            missing as though bitten off by some land predator.</p>
     <p>“Andy,” I said, “the island itself is probably not regulation-size.”</p>
     <p>“Look!” interjected Elizabeth—and for a moment I feared she might have seen a McDonald’s restaurant somewhere.  “There’s more of it there.”</p>
     <p>More, she meant, of the island.</p> 
     <p>It was low tide.  Beyond a stone wall, a mere inch above sea level, was an expanse of sand.  We went out to it to do some exploring, our only gear curiosity and our 
            five senses.  There were puddles of gently eddying seawater scattered about, barely ankle-deep.  In them were snails and starfish and sea urchins.  There was, 
            as well, the occasional plastic water bottle, left by some half-wit tourist.  The bottle now longed to join the billions of its fellows suspended in the 
            Mid-Pacific Gyre, a floating garbage patch in the ocean twice the size of Texas.  I picked up the bottles whenever I could, muttering as I did.  
            Everywhere—everywhere was despoilment.  I was a modern version of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner, with a rhyme of my own—</p>

                                              <p>“Water bottles, water bottles everywhere,<br>
                                                They will never rot or sink;<br>
                                                Bottles, bottles everywhere—<br>
            When will tourists stop and think?”</p>  

     <p>Our exploration of the sand bar was brief since of course we did not collect any of the organisms we encountered.  I brought back two crumpled plastic bottles, the sum of 
            my discovery, and threw them in a trash can, away from the reach of the Mid-Pacific Gyre—away from its reach, at least, until sea levels rise to Al Gore’s 
            specifications.</p>
     <p>We returned to the pier in time to see a seaborne invasion of Japanese tourists, lately discharged from a flotilla of motorized vessels such as ours.  The tourists 
            crowded the head of the pier where we had disembarked, their floats and gear obstructing our progress.  Spandex suits, like octopuses out of water, lay flaccid 
            and rumpled on the planks.  In addition, there was a contingent of Filipinos bringing supplies to the resort’s kitchen—fresh produce and lots and lots of 
            packaged food items, principally ramen noodles.  I saw no canisters of ping-pong balls.</p>
     <p>The stairs leading into the water were now a standing-room-only margin of concrete, and the sea itself fairly roiled with recreation.  The fish-to-tourist ratio had 
            radically changed, and my companions and I were glad to be leaving.</p>
     <p>Back on the boat, the wind again in our faces, I counted my blessings: Virginia, shaded under the canopy, eyes hidden behind dark glasses; Andy, stretched out on the 
            deck like a slab of youthful alabaster; Liz and Michael, cooing at each other on the long vinyl cushion.  Gus was by himself, whether deep in thought or letting 
            his mind go blank, I could not tell.  Some people can do both simultaneously, having a talent for metaphysical multi-tasking.  Adrian busied himself with doing 
            nothing.  I was ensconced in a bean bag, a hatchling too lazy to sit up.  Our crew of three kept to themselves in the back of the boat; this was all very tiresome 
            to them—just another work shift.</p>    
     <p>Presently, we arrived at another island—or arrived off the coast of another island, this one being part of a marine sanctuary.  We dropped anchor behind a line of other 
            tourist boats, perhaps five hundred yards from shore.  Here we jumped into the sea, which was many times deeper than our natural aquarium at Nalusuan had been.  
            The waves were choppier here, the water not as warm, the fish larger, and the gravelly bottom vaguely intimidating and without question inaccessible to us.  Where 
            the shelf dropped off below it, the water was blue.  No bottom could be seen by anyone swimming there, just an abyssal dimness, a noncommittal stare projected 
            from the depths.  We kept away from that side of the boat, and confined our frolicking to the friendlier water near the island, where kelp and coral and swaying 
            sea grass and pale but familiar earth, beneath the waves, formed a reassuring boundary.  Finless and without gills, we needed the sight of some semblance of land 
            to ground and orient ourselves.</p>
     <p>There was dead coral too, among the living—white skeletal mounds on the seafloor, evidence of the ceaseless exploitation raking the planet’s resources.  Despoilment, 
            again.  Alongside the dead coral might as well have been scattered the bones of tuskless elephants and dehorned rhinos, stumps of ruined rain forests, and 
            contaminated ore, some contained in plastic bottles, leached out from the open pits of industry.  Someday, I imagined, this marine sanctuary will drain into a 
            massive rift on the bottom of the ocean, and seawater and lava and the heat of subduction will cause all hell to break loose, leaving the entire Philippine 
            archipelago high and dry.</p>
     <p>Why did I so easily segue from poetic to melancholic to apocalyptic?  These attitudes land predictably on my spiritual plate, as though they were appetizer, entrée, 
            and dessert.  What, anyway, was the secret of Nalusuan Island?  I never did discern it.  Had there been clues?  Fortune-cookie truisms hidden inside ping-pong 
            balls?  What about our current island?  What face was hiding so coyly behind that frilly fan?  In all the years he was marooned there, did Robinson Crusoe ever 
            uncover his island’s secret?  After all, islands are simply mountains rising from the seabed—was that the big secret?  That islands aren’t introspective loners 
            at all, but that many fathoms down, they’re playing footsie with one other, and trying not to laugh?  And the ones that laugh become volcanoes?</p>  
     <p>From an apocalyptic turn of mind, I reverted momentarily to my inner cynic.  And then, for the benefit of society, I switched to low-power, stand-by mode…</p> 
     <p>Emerging into air and unrefracted light, I gasped and laughed, spitting seawater from my mouth.</p>                                
     <p>“I found Nemo!”</p>
     <p>The comic, again.  Comic and clownfish, in a matinee show.</p> 
     <p>Hungry, we ceased our cavorting, and partook of our lunch of puso, chicken adobo, and some meager vegetables.  Gus asked if we had had enough fun.  We looked around, 
            all smiles, all wet, ruddy with exertion.  Ours was a wonderful world, despite its being in a bubble.  We nodded, resigned to the inevitable end of all things.</p>  
     <p>“Yes,” I replied for everyone.  “I guess so.”</p>
     <p>It was not yet two o’clock, and we were already heading back.  In truth, we had tired of having fun.  Humans may ski down powdered slopes only so many times; may make 
            love only so often; may linger in a museum only so long before they are overcome with tedium; and so we wearied of the sea.  That is why God, as Emerson observed, 
            cut eternity up into “a neat succession of new mornings.”  We are easily stimulated and quickly satiated—weaklings who have subdued all nature except that of our 
            own race.</p>
     <p>We saw, against the sky, some lucky chap (or Jap) parasailing.  Farther away, the condominium high-rises of Mactan shone pink and white.  Finally the ramp came into view, 
            and received our boat’s hull.  And with a thud, our island-hopping came to an end.</p>
     <p>Winding through Punta Engano, we passed Lapu-Lapu’s Monument, the counterpoint to Magellan’s Cross in Cebu.  On this spot in 1521, Lapu-Lapu and his warriors defeated 
            Magellan’s men in the Battle of Mactan.  Somewhere in that dirt was a rusty machete that delayed by forty years the Spanish conquest of the Philippines.  Did the 
            ruler of Mactan, upon his victory, imagine that the helmeted and bearded white men were gone for good?  If not, did he think they would return in a year?  And 
            after twenty years, did Lapu-Lapu begin to sleep easy at night?</p>
     <p>Forty years after their setback, the Spaniards came back in full strength, and 7,107 islands, in due course, were named after King Philippe II.</p>
     <p>We decided to have lunch again—our simple fare on the boat had not been enough food.  But before that, we needed some smoothies to cool our parched throats.  Gus parked 
            the Mitsubishi, and we went in a grocery store.  We got our smoothies and sundry other items, chips and nuts and candy to munch on.  There were security guards 
            patrolling the aisles, and occasionally customers would ask them where certain products were shelved.  Were these guards actually undercover stock boys—part of 
            an inexplicable sting operation?  Was paying an armed man to watch the frozen foods section actually cheaper than installing a closed-circuit camera by the 
            freezer?</p>
     <p>The labor market said it was.</p>
     <p>Leaving the grocery store, we heard Michael exclaim, as though he had seen Superman flying: “Look!  Isn’t that a—?”</p>
     <p>“Chow King!” Elizabeth cheered.</p>
     <p>Although they were everywhere in Cebu, we had so far not patronized any of Chow King’s restaurants, and now an opportunity presented itself.  It was as if Liz had 
            picked up a “chance card” in a game of Filipinopoly—one which ordered her to “Eat halo-halo at Chow King; do not pass GO.”  My daughter led the way past the 
            security guard, and planted herself straightaway at the counter.</p>
     <p>Andy said, “Liz, you know we’re not at a McDonald’s, right?”</p>
     <p>But Liz and Michael had, since Majestic Restaurant, become halo-halo addicts.  I wondered whether all their oohing and aahing earlier on the boat had been their pining 
            and craving for the dessert.</p>  
     <p>We ordered, and then took a table.  The dumplings and beef on fried rice came, and we ate those eagerly, but we all knew the real reason we were there.  A hush of 
            expectancy, familiar to auction-goers, hung over our table.  When the halo-halo was served, all three bowls of it, the hush erupted into raucous enthusiasm, 
            familiar to aficionados of cockfighting.  We took turns sampling the dessert, stirring each bowl as though swishing fine wine.</p>  
     <p>The verdict in the end was that Majestic’s remained the best halo-halo in the land, its delicately shaved ice making all the difference.  Michael, smacking his lips, 
            was chanting, “That was good, good, that was very good.”  Liz was finishing off her chocolate dumplings, ordered in a moment of recklessness.  Adrian looked 
            pleased, as he always did after any sort of meal.  Gus was checking his Blackberry.  Virginia was taking pictures of us, while Andy, full, was too lethargic 
            to do anything but rock in his chair.  I was taking mental notes of these proceedings, in case a twenty-thousand-word essay needed composing after our trip.</p>
     <p>“Well, that’s that,” I announced.  “We can all fly home to Chicago now.”</p>
     <p>A look of uncertainty crossed Adrian’s face when he heard these words.  “You mean—?”</p>
     <p>“But first we need to say goodbye to Mama,” I clarified.</p>
     <p>On the way home, crossing the bridge into Cebu, inching through traffic, Andy fell asleep, dragging his sister and brother-in-law with him to their sugary slumber-land.</p>
     <p>Mama was waiting for us, ready with her home-cooked meal.  She smiled in greeting, a smile richer and sweeter than any halo-halo ever could be.
