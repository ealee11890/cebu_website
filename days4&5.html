        <h3>Bohol</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b>
          <p>At dawn on Wednesday, Ariston and Joy came by the house, and my American family, backpacks in hand, boarded their Nissan.  We headed for the ferry which would 
            take us, SUV and all, east across the strait to Bohol, an island (cue the Howard Shore music) lost in the mist of time.  Bohol’s geology has not sufficiently 
            congealed into rock; the hills in its hinterland are made of primeval chocolate.  No dinosaurs roam its interior, but tarsiers and iguanas and pythons inhabit i
            ts forests.  Mainly, what sets Bohol apart is its pace of life, a palpably slow-motion undulation so graceful that a modern mind, constantly rushing, is tricked 
            into perceiving a reversal in time’s direction.</p>
          <p>The ferry crossing took us past several islands, each the size of a soccer field, and about as green.  Outrigger canoes bobbed in the turquoise water—fishermen 
            tending their nets.  In another hour, the coast of Bohol loomed near, and soon we were docking at the port of Tubigon.  It was close to lunchtime.  Liz pointed 
            at a familiar yellow M in the distance.  “Let’s go to McDonald’s!” she whooped.</p>   
          <p>(Cut the Howard Shore music.  Now.)</p>                                                    
          <p>I didn’t know whether to hang my head in shame, or to raise my fists.</p> 
          <p>“Can we go through the sail-through and save time?”  Andy quipped.</p>  
          <p>Joy asked if we wanted to eat at “Makdo,” her term of corporate endearment for McDonald’s.  I shrugged, but everyone else wanted the yellow M.  “You’re not 
            going to like the pancakes and rice,” I warned.  And sure enough our orders tasted like different portions of the same value meal.</p>  
          <p>Lunch done, we filed into the Nissan, and sped through the countryside, Ariston driving like a Formula-One racer.  We passengers had a choice: either to 
            view with equanimity the passing scenery—the huts, coconut trees, water buffalo, and intermittent glimpses of the sea—or else to bite our knuckles raw at the 
            sight of chickens and children darting across the two-lane road while buses and motorcycles and bicycles and pushcarts and our own Japanese juggernaut slalomed 
            in opposite directions.  Ariston’s presence on the island had caused its leisurely undulation to spike to a quiver.</p>    
          <p>Sometime later, Andy would confess: “After the first ten minutes, I figured Uncle Ariston knew what he was doing because if he didn’t, we wouldn’t have lasted 
            ten minutes.”</p>
          <p>In eight or ten hours of driving, Ariston had nary an accident; nothing he did elicited the attention of a somnolent buffalo.  Weirdly, there were no signs of 
            road kill anywhere.  Was Bohol a variant of Shangri-La, where some mystic force disallowed, no matter what, the possibility of animals being run over by wheels?  
            The spiritual angle was plausible.  When we arrived at the capital, Tagbilaran City, we found that the public conveyances, jeepneys and tricycles both, all 
            displayed a Bible verse or some quaint religious manifesto, painted on, or hung as a banner.  Virginia was thrilled.  I wondered what the ACLU back home would 
            think of this.  And my next thought was: God bless Bohol Island, Big Macs and all!</p>  
          <p>We pressed on, squeezing through urban traffic until we got back on the main road.  Bridges along this road and throughout the island were in the process of 
            being repaired, from the destruction wrought by the earthquake of 2013.  The reconstruction was painstaking work; we saw hardly any earth-moving equipment and 
            only small crews of men digging or hauling dirt.  But the seriousness of the effort, if not its progress, was plain to see.</p>
          <p>It was close to noon when we reached our first stop, the town of Loboc.  Here we boarded a barge and cruised down the pristine and picturesque Loboc River.  
            On one section of this river, Francis Ford Coppola had filmed Apocalypse Now.  The barge was a floating dining hall.  One long table bisected the deck, surrounded 
            by smaller ones which were ringed with chairs.  On the long table were bowls of rice and noodles and sinigang soup, trays of pork adobo, steamed crab, grilled 
            fish, seaweed salad, greens, beefsteak, stewed potatoes, pudding and, cynically, fried chicken.  For dessert: flan, sweet sticky rice, whole mangoes, grapes, 
            pineapple, papaya, more mangoes, cantaloupe and watermelon.  There were bananas laid surreptitiously among some floral arrangements, but these, like the flowers 
            themselves, were likely decorative—or else they were reserved for philistine diners who preferred fried chicken over exotic viands.</p>
          <p>The barge turned around at a bend where some falls, though adding to the natural beauty, obstructed further advance.  On the way back, the barge stopped beside 
            a bamboo stage built close to the bank, where we were serenaded by local women in costume, playing ukuleles, and smiling bravely at strangers.  A couple was 
            dancing the tinikling, hopping in and out of a pair of bamboo poles being banged rhythmically on the floor and against each other by a man and a woman, presumably 
            licensed and bonded.  In a while, the show ended, and our barge proceeded to the mooring area.  Satiated, we disembarked, wobbling towards our parked vehicle, 
            past the pay toilets and T-shirt stands and rows of minibuses which threatened to turn this part of paradise into a whistle stop on the way to Wisconsin Dells.</p>
          <p>On the road again, we digested our food.  Before long, we were climbing and making hairpin turns.  On his DVD player, installed beside the Nissan’s sun visor, 
            Ariston had on a documentary about the End Times, a bleak subject under any circumstances.  Something about eschatology takes the edge off the prospect of plunging 
            into a ravine.  Nonetheless the ride upward was exhilarating, and when we reached our destination, we all breathed a sigh of relief, grateful that civilization had 
            not ended, and that our individual lives, for reasons known only to Ariston, had been spared.</p> 
          <p>Bohol’s famed Chocolate Hills lay before us.  We ascended the 210 steps to the overlook, and took in the view.  There they were: the Chocolate Hills, consisting 
            in fact of prehistoric limestone, and not of cake ingredients.  They looked brown because no trees or grass could grow on the thin soil.  Once upon a time, the 
            whole valley was a seafloor—so long ago that there was no one present then to take a selfie with fish in the background.</p>
          <p>The tourists were clicking away with their cameras.  Some workers were repairing a portion of the concrete platform, damaged during the same earthquake which 
            brought down the bridges.  One man was cutting a steel rod with a hacksaw, by hand.  At that rate, he might not have finished his task before the next ice age 
            commenced covering the Chocolate Hills in frosting.  What amazed me was that this man was probably not an hourly union worker.  What was the point and advantage 
            of being that slow?</p>
          <p>Back again on the road; children and chickens scampering before Uncle Ariston.  We pulled into a nature preserve and watched tarsiers napping.  They clung to 
            branches, these most diminutive of primates, always beneath a large leaf—for shade, or to camouflage themselves, or merely to look more photogenic, the rangers 
            could not tell.  Before long, we had our fill of napping tarsiers.  We paid a man to chop coconuts, and we drank their juice and ate the meat, feeling like 
            authentic tribespeople as we did so.  Tossing the empty husks into a basket, we felt even nobler, recycling in the jungle, not waking the tarsiers, not licking 
            the chocolate off the hills.</p>
          <p>Next, we drove to a zip-line area.  Liz and Andy, strapped and helmeted, whizzed 1,600 feet across a gorge, arms outstretched.  Three hundred feet down, the 
            Loboc River wound through the tropical vegetation, a python waiting to devour any Icaruses who happened to come unbuckled from their straps.  Michael could not 
            be persuaded to tempt fate.  I, for my part, had “been there and done that” in 2012, and saw no reason to get another endorphin rush.  Virginia’s excuse was that 
            she was our official videographer, a position she had only that moment assigned to herself.</p>
          <p>That done, we drove some more kilometers to Baclayon Church, built in 1727 by the ubiquitous, tireless and (in my mom’s book)  villainous Jesuits.  We arrived 
            too late.  The ticket window was shut; the area was closed for the day.  In any case, the church’s bell tower and stone portico, undergoing repairs, were hidden 
            in scaffolding.  The roof had just been rebuilt.  Too late indeed; the earthquake of 2013 had gotten there before us.  So we called it a day and turned around, 
            heading for the town of Valencia, where Joy’s mother and relatives lived, seemingly since 1727.</p> 
          <p>In Valencia we checked into our hotel rooms and freshened up.  Night had fallen; the nocturnal tarsiers would have awakened by now, their saucer eyes alert 
            for crickets.  We drove to Joy’s ancestral home, which was part residence, part general store, part distribution center.  Inside were goods of all kinds: 
            electrical supplies, lumber, groceries, hardware, household products—stacked in hallways and stored on rafters in a marvel of organization.  Tucked away in one 
            corner was an Internet café.  The living quarters were on three floors, possible four, connected by a discontinuous yet comprehensive system of stairs.  
            The building was like a castle, the center of its world: a Walmart in Shangri-La.</p>
          <p>Joy’s mother and aunts and uncles all lived and worked in this house.  We had dinner with them—hearty country dishes washed down with Coke.  Their hospitality 
            was extraordinary.  They handed us two bags of mangoes to take with us.  Somewhere in their backyard, I was sure, was a stout mango tree that supplied the 
            family all season long with fruit, with a surplus for trading.</p>
          <p>Back at the hotel, everyone else hit the sack instantly.  I took a dip in the pool, which was fed by a mountain spring that ran through caverns measureless 
            to man, rushing out of a cliff before meandering down to a sunless sea.  Our pleasure-dome was in fact the pink and rectilinear Badiang Spring Resort— 
            government-run, as was Kubla Khan’s.</p>
          <p>After breakfast the next day, we drove to Hinagdanan Cave on Panglao Island.  Tickets in hand, and groping, we descended the cave, skirted the pool that lay 
            within, surveyed the stalactites and stalagmites, and watched the birds (or bats?) flitting in and out of a collapsed section of the ceiling.  An interesting 
            cave, but it was a cave like any other, notwithstanding its freshwater pool.  Once you’ve experienced the magnitude and stygian darkness of Mammoth Cave in 
            Kentucky, every other hole in the ground accessible to tourists is going to pale, or dim, by comparison.  Ascending our little cave was free of charge, in any 
            case, and we took advantage of this.</p>
          <p>The Nissan was hot as an oven.  We climbed in and sought lunch.  Ariston knew of a nice seaside hotel in the area, and after a few wrong turns, we found 
            ourselves at Flushing Meadows Resort.  The place had everything we desired: white sand and shells on the beach, chlorinated water in the pool.  The weather 
            was perfect; the native-themed facilities were, as well.  Why the name “Flushing Meadows,” we had no idea.  I espied no meadows in the fierce sunlight, and 
            didn’t care to visualize the act of flushing.  There exists, in Queens, New York, the park of the same name, but I saw no similarity between that park and 
            our equatorial playground.  Maybe a road sign had gotten switched, or perhaps some drunk had come up with the name in a contest.  Perhaps both establishments 
            had the same corporate owner, globalism being so trendy nowadays.</p>  
          <p>Lunch was served, family style.  We had halo-halo for dessert, for Michael’s sake.  Later we swam in the sea, lay in the sun, and then swam in the pool, 
            in accordance with the regional recipe for tanning.  I picked up one smooth stone from the shore for my collection.  Everything was perfect except for the 
            resort’s incongruous name.</p> 
          <p>By the time we were back in Tubigon to take the ferry home, near evening, I had gotten over the name. Flushing Meadows.  Makdo.  Whatever.</p>
          <p>The ferry, on the return trip, seemed slower, seemed bored to be doing the same voyage over and over.  The dark sea and the dark sky allowed no cues of the 
            vessel’s movement.  Some redneck behind me was smoking, his fumes mingling with those of the diesel engine.  I didn’t want to make a scene, on account of my 
            companions.  Rednecks get away with everything, in any culture.</p>
          <p>At last Cebu appeared in the distance, dots of incandescence spreading away from a neon-lit high-rise.  The skyline was noticeably wider and taller than when 
            I was a boy.  Not quite the architectural showpiece that Chicago was, seen at dusk from Lake Michigan, or Kowloon from a Star ferry; but Cebu held its own in 
            gritty fashion.  It held me, exhausted, enthralled—and, despite the breeze, asphyxiated by the redneck’s cigarette smoke.
