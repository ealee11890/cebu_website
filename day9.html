        <h3>To the South and Back</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b><p>Now that we had seen the world’s smallest primate (Day Four, Bohol), and fed on honey-dew in paradisiacal milk (Day Eight, Cebu), it was 
          time to swim with the largest fish in the ocean, the whale shark.  For this excursion, we turned once more to our trusty maestro of the highway, Uncle Ariston.</p>  
          <p>Early Monday, the familiar Nissan appeared in front of Mama’s house, still dusty from its adventures in Bohol.  Ariston and Joy herded us all in, and we drove south.  
          Talisay…Naga…Sibonga…Argao—towns I had known obliquely as a young man whizzed by like so many billboards.  It was obvious that the province of Cebu was more populous 
          than Bohol, from the road traffic and the helter-skelter activity of its open markets.  There was more industry and a larger government presence.  Fewer chickens 
          scampered before us.  Many of the fowl were in the marketplaces, roasting in skewers.</p>
          <p>Two hours into our trip, Andy said, “Uncle Ariston, in Iowa I can drive for five hours without ever having to pass another car.”</p>
          <p>Ariston shook his head and smiled, whether amazed at the fact, or contemptuous of it, I could not tell.  As usual he got us to our destination safely, right around eleven 
          o’clock.  The sign by the road welcomed us to Oslob, and immediately we knew it was a tourist town, from the Korean script below the English words.  Also, there were 
          pictures of whale sharks everywhere, alongside lists of prices and guarantees of satisfaction.  Alligators in Florida; bears in Yellowstone; whale sharks in Oslob.  
          We turned into the last establishment, hoping it was the least ruthless of the tourist traps in town.</p>
          <p>A ticket cost about ten dollars, the price of a plush toy animal at the Shedd Aquarium gift shop.  Renting a face mask was another two, for a total of twelve bucks per 
          person, less than it cost to park for two hours in downtown Chicago.  We parked for free on the gravel.</p> 
          <p>Something Ariston had said earlier puzzled me.  “Do you mean to say,” I inquired, “that two hundred feet beyond this beach, we can be meeting the whales—I mean, the 
          sharks?”</p>  
          <p>Ariston nodded. </p>
          <p>“Not two kilometers out in the water?” I persisted.  “Two hundred feet?”</p>
          <p>“Right.”</p>
          <p>I couldn’t fathom why such behemoths would swim so close to shore.</p>
          <p>As it turned out, the men who took us to the sharks on their boats fed the sharks quantities of shrimp.  I observed the men scooping the food out of baskets, and tossing 
          it into the water.  A marine scientist from South Korea some decades back, careless with his bait of tiny crustaceans, had discovered the presence of whale sharks in 
          the area.  The Korean’s serendipitous realization gave birth to tourism in Oslob, and now every adult male in town was tossing shrimp into the sea instead of 
          hauling fish from it.</p>
          <p>The system worked.  Jumping into the water with my snorkel, I was met immediately by silhouettes gliding beneath my legs.  These weren’t the sixty-footers out in the 
          Indian Ocean, the specimens BBC was so fond of filming.  Ours were fifteen or twenty feet long, gray with mottles of white, their maws like snow shovels.  I could 
          see several of them at the same time, docile as cows.  Still, I didn’t want one, even on its diet of store-bought shrimp, to sideswipe my torso.</p>
          <p>Liz and Andy were in the water too, Andy trying valiantly to go deeper, but having a tough time submerging with his life vest on.  Who says engineers are detail-oriented?  
          On vacation, they’re apt to miss the obvious.</p>  
          <p>Virginia and Michael contented themselves with ogling the occasional dorsal fin rising above the waves, the rest of the filter-feeding fish moving lazily beneath, like 
          some shadowy, humungous carp.  I could see why Peter Benchley had not chosen a whale shark as his novel’s villain.  Jaws, had it opened with the sentence—The great 
          fish moved silently in the night water, propelled by short sweeps of its crescent tail, searching for some shrimp to eat—would not have grabbed any reader’s attention.</p> 
          <p>Napping tarsiers and whale sharks feeding have one thing in common: anyone watching them is bound to tire of it eventually.  We got our twelve bucks’ worth, and headed 
          for shore.</p>
          <p>Noon—our turn to eat.  We chose an eatery nearby, and Liz handled the bill this time.  Between the sea and the road were cottages and stalls, tables set up, bathroom 
          facilities, posted regulations.  I heard Korean and Mandarin phrases.  Even the Visayan spoken here sounded different from that of the big city.  Oslob had become 
          polyglot.  “Where to next?” I asked our hosts.</p>
          <p>Joy announced that we were going to a waterfall, some eighteen kilometers south on the main road, around the tip of the island. 
          <p>“We’re rounding the tip of the island?” I echoed.</p>
          <p>It sounded reckless.  In theory, we could have pointed to a spot on a map of Cebu and claimed, “Here is where, if we hadn’t turned, our car would have gone headlong 
          over the opposite shoulder and plunged into the sea, and who knows what other kinds of sharks live in those waters!”  In truth, however, rounding that bend had 
          about as much impact as crossing into a different time zone on an interstate highway.  Both maneuvers were cartological conceits.  But I was in a mood to romanticize.  
          All of a sudden, I was Ishmael.  And Ishmael, I wager, had never seen a whale shark up close, for all the fuss he made about Moby Dick.</p>    
          <p>Liz and Virginia, for their part, did not relish the prospect of squeezing one more time into the back seat of the Nissan.  They had already ridden for three hours that 
          morning, and now they were full from lunch.  Sighing, they climbed in anyway.  Little did they know that we would need all that nourishment for their climb up the 
          waterfall.</p> 
          <p>Whenever I’ve gone on a long road trip in the States—driving, say, from Illinois to South Carolina—I have always been struck by the vast girth of the American landmass.  
          I had the opposite feeling, seeing Negros Island from the tip of Cebu.  It occurred to me that the Philippine archipelago could not be appreciable in size since, 
          without benefit of binoculars, I could see two major islands from the back seat of an SUV.  Bohol lay hazily to the northeast, and Negros filled the Nissan’s windshield.
          The sea didn’t seem to do much in the way of separating province from province.  It was an odd sensation, and had the effect of making the Philippines appear to be 
          created on a human scale, though it had been thrown up by volcanoes.</p>
          <p>We passed Santander, from where a mere half-hour on a ferry would transport one to the city of Dumaguete, on Negros.  I visited Dumaguete in the summer of 1984, attending a 
          creative writing workshop in Silliman University.  I and some fellow scribes spent three weeks discussing each other’s fiction and poetry, hoping to learn from the 
          interchange, and eager to inflict subtle bruises on each other’s delicate egos.  We fancied ourselves to be deep thinkers with high aspirations.  Our future was rosy.  
          In Cebu, I was performing in dinner theater and on television.  A year after the workshop, I would be teaching English in Xiamen, China.  My memories of Dumaguete and 
          of that whole placid phase of my life came arcing out of the past like shooting stars at dawn.  It seemed to me that the act of remembering something so remote in 
          time should have required more strenuous effort.  The strait between Cebu and Negros was not only narrow; it did nothing to obstruct the nostalgia flooding me.  
          If anything, the flood and the sea comingled, producing a brew with a most bittersweet taste.</p>  
          <p>Where, at fifty-six, did I find myself?  Living in American suburbia, and working for the federal government.  This was arguably preferable to Ana Lynn’s—or any domestic 
          helper’s—lot in life.  Ana Lynn earned a pittance for her labor, yes, but my property tax bill alone exceeded two years of her income.  Examined in this way, my lot 
          was the sorrier one.  Virginia worked as an inclusion aide in the school district—not a fancy job.  At home, she had tasks as onerous as any servant’s.  We were all 
          working (to use Jerry Seinfeld’s phrase) for “the same oat bag, fellas.”</p>  
          <p>I snapped out of my reverie in time to see the turn-off for Aguinid Falls.  Ariston parked the vehicle in a basketball court, and off we marched into the woods, following 
          a gravel lane.</p>  
          <p>We came to a shack, and were met by the local guides.</p> 
          <p>Guides? I thought.  When Virginia and I and two little kids named Elizabeth and Andy were at Niagara Falls, we had needed no guides; just tickets and ponchos.  I had hiked 
          nearly halfway down the Grand Canyon with nothing but a hat and three bottles of water; had gone up Vernal Fall in Yosemite all on my own.  Guides—here?</p>
          <p>But I was fifty-six, and needed a guide after all.</p>
          <p>Aguinid Falls tumbled out of a hill in a series of minor cataracts, seven in all.  We hiked around a turbid pool as we began our ascent, splashing through progressively 
          clearer water, tiptoeing on mossy rocks.  We passed through clefts among the boulders, while our guides held our hands and snapped pictures of us grimacing and 
          whooping or looking decidedly uncertain about a particular foothold.  The guides would point to an invisible “X” and say, “Here, sir!” or “Here, ma’am!” whenever 
          we looked unsure about how to proceed.  They even told us when to pick up our sandals, and when to wear them, as the necessity arose.  The guides were superb, and 
          I was humbled.  I was amazed at Virginia’s gumption as she negotiated her way up the waterfall.  She suffered from a fear of heights, and to see her cast her 
          misgivings aside like a soaked and useless towel made an impression on me.  Virginia was a revelation, and not just because she had on a bathing suit.</p>
          <p>At one point, the townspeople had carved little hollows into the slippery stones, going so far as to stretch a rope up one steep incline, just to help visitors along.  
          Michael, ever cautious, stayed back when he reached the third level of the falls.  The rest of us ascended to the fifth, where a ledge allowed us to take turns jumping 
          into a deep pool, Andy clowning the whole time.</p>  
          <p>We immersed our feet in some of the gentler rivulets, to expose our toes and ankles to schools of nibbling minnows happy to detach dead skin from our wrinkled epidermis.  
          The minnows charged less for their service than did the ladies at the massage parlor for theirs.  Everything was free!  We were free!  It was for this instant of 
          happiness that we had traveled half the length of the island—for this one instant that we had flown halfway around the globe.</p>
          <p>Well, no; nothing was free.  The airfare was on my credit card, and every other expense was paid for in cash.  The moment passed, followed by that inevitable bittersweet 
          taste on the tongue.</p> 
          <p>We did not climb any further, seeing that no other hikers did.  Above us, there was no trail discernible to our eyes.  Only the guides knew the way, but from that point on, 
          when they said “Here,” there would be nothing to see but our own folly.</p>
          <p>So we headed back, Ariston and Andy nimble as goats, their shadows lost in the walls of tangled foliage enclosing the fall.  Michael joined us where we had left him, still 
          cheerful despite the boredom of his wait.  At the shack, we left our guides a generous tip.  We changed into dry clothes, and traced our way back to the basketball 
          court, to find Joy asleep in the Nissan.</p>
          <p>That was the end of our adventures that day, unless you count stopping in Argao for some torta pastry, and purchasing a kilo of lechon in Carcar as escapades in themselves.  
          Virginia and Elizabeth suffered through the long ride home, cramped and exhausted.  Andy and Michael and I, in the middle row, sat slumped over our chests, heads 
          wobbly from the weight of opposing images—whale sharks indifferent to us, and a myriad minnows, would-be piranhas, nibbling crazily at our feet.</p>
          <p>Ariston, driving at night, was no less expert than in full daylight.  But traffic was heavy; the road unlit.  Pedestrians moved like legions of phantoms; I myself felt like 
          a wraith, mere eyes watching a darkening world.  A more dreadful commute, even in a Chicago winter, I could not recall.</p>
          <p>When we arrived, Mama had a meal ready for us.  She served the lechon and torta that Joy had bought, and offered me a days-old avocado shake, which she had retrieved from 
          the refrigerator.  I made the mistake of consuming it, and suddenly I was a wraith with a substantially upset stomach.
