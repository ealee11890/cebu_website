        <h3>Prophetic Epilogue</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b><p>Late Saturday morning, everyone awoke and fixed his or her own breakfast.  That’s the American way.  Cereal, milk, toast and coffee—maybe 
          a piece of fruit; no frills.  Jet-lag had not yet transformed our bodies into sacks of bowling balls.  That would come later.</p>  
     <p>I sent Mama an email assuring her of my love and affection.  I phrased my sentiments delicately, so as to disguise my feelings of guilt.  I have had practice with 
          creative writing.</p>  
     <p>Andy left for Ames, Iowa, later in the morning.  He was moving from his rented trailer home into an apartment.  School was starting, and he had to prepare for his 
          work with the college students.  Besides, Natalie would already have been settled for a while on campus—there was that too.  Just because Natalie was a senior 
          that year did not mean she needed no attention.</p>
     <p>Early in the afternoon, Liz and Michael also departed for their home in Des Moines, Iowa.  The rest of the summer, on weekends and holidays, Liz and Michael would set 
          up a stall at flea markets and county fairs and at various outdoor events, selling halo-halo to fair-goers and passers-by and other unsuspecting Caucasians.  
          Michael prepared the ingredients, taking care to shave the ice well, while Liz put the ingredients together and collected the money.  They earned enough to buy a 
          food truck, and ply their product all over the county.  In 2018 Liz became pregnant and gave birth to a son, whom she named Daniel in honor of Michael’s dad.  
          Daniel was followed soon after by Alexandra, a curly-haired beauty with almond eyes like her mother.  Brother and sister, early on, helped in their parents’ 
          halo-halo business, which in a decade had grown so large that it had franchises blanketing the Midwest.  The firm was named “The Holiest Halo-Halo,” and though 
          it remained profitable, its founders and owners were wearying of the concoction’s taste, having licked and swallowed so much of the darn thing.</p>
     <p>When Daniel was twenty-two years old, already an accomplished businessman, he decided to take a journey to the homeland of his parents’ halo-halo.  He and his sister 
          Alexandra flew to Cebu City to taste for themselves the original masterpiece, perfected at Majestic Restaurant, hoping that by doing so they might revive in 
          themselves the passion which had waned in their parents’ hearts and palates.</p>  
     <p>Daniel and Alexandra introduced themselves to the manager of Majestic Restaurant, and explained their intention.  The manager assented happily.  He led the two young 
          Americans to the kitchen, and there Daniel and Alexandra met the magic of the ube, the beans, and the frosty ice.</p>
     <p>“Thank you,” said Daniel to the manager, whose name was Winston.  “It tastes heavenly.  I believe I get it now.”</p>
     <p>Winston was gracious but also curious.  “How is it,” he asked, “that you call your product “the holiest halo-halo”?  Are you religious?”</p>
     <p>“Actually, yes,” said Alexandra.  “We’re both Christians and so are my parents.”</p>  
     <p>“Oh!  I am Christian too!”</p> 
     <p>“Really?  That’s terrific,” Daniel pronounced, and venturing further enquired: “And how did you become a Christian, Winston?”</p>
     <p>“Well, when I was a boy, around twelve or eleven years old, and going to school in Bogo—that’s my hometown—a group of foreigners came to our school and told us about 
          Jesus.”</p>
     <p>“And that’s how you came to know Christ?”</p>
     <p>“Yes!” Winston exulted.  “And to think that if that group had not stayed another day in Bogo, they would never have come to my school.  They were supposed to leave on 
          Sunday, but their bus did not show up, so on Monday I was born again!”</p>
          <p>“That’s a great story,” said Daniel, who knew only half of it.</p></b>
