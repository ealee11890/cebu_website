        <h3>Colton</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b><p>The Marriott Hotel, as one might have expected, had half a dozen security guards checking every car and truck that passed its gate.  The 
          guards carried long-handled angled mirrors, with which to view the vehicles’ underside.  Our van made it through.</p> 
          <p>Mama went to church at the Marriott.  The service, held in a banquet room, was contemporary, attended by many young people.  The preacher’s message was on forgiveness.  
          The preacher, speaking of his deceased father, choked up in the middle of his sermon, but otherwise he was calm and straightforward, and he finished punctually.  
          The music wasn’t my kind of music.  I prefer the old hymns, so precisely and poetically composed, their melodies formal and nuanced.  Much of contemporary 
          Christian music, though heart-felt when sung, sounds like the first drafts of mediocre songs, the verbs and adjectives strewn willy-nilly with little regard 
          for subtlety or meter.  I know.  I know that’s not the point of worship.  King David, dancing, and singing his own lyrics, probably sounded unsophisticated too, 
          compared to some Lutheran choirs.</p>  
          <p>Forgive me.  On my bad days, I’m a snarky critic; on my good days, I’m a secret snob.  Heed the preacher’s counsel—forgive.</p>
          <p>When church was done, Mama went home to rest, Adrian accompanying her.  My gang and I went with Gus.  We went to Majestic Restaurant to have lunch.  We all 
            knew, however, that lunch was but a prelude to halo-halo.  Such sacrilege on a Sunday!</p>
          <p>Lunch was superb, but here is what Majestic’s halo-halo looked like: identical to the others except for the ice.  The ice was shaved into fine threads of 
            frost, the velvety ube glistening beneath it like a miniature alpine lake.  It was this ice, melting on our tongues without antagonizing our teeth; this ice 
            transporting the ube, molecule by molecule, swirling round our palettes with its gifts of sugar; it was this ice that had formed a masterpiece.  We had ordered 
            three bowls, one vanilla thrown in as a gustatory baseline.</p> 
          <p>When the bowls were empty, we had our champion.  From then on, every halo-halo we ate would be a challenger only, an upstart, a pretender.</p> 
          <p>“I hear Chow King’s halo-halo is pretty good too,” Gus opined.</p>
          <p>We stared at him from around our table, our mouths open in a collective, voiceless “No!”</p>
          <p>Gus treated.  We thanked him, and filed past the restaurant’s security guard, toward the mall.</p> 
          <p>While Liz and Virginia went to get their facials, we guys checked out a café.  Then, with the aimlessness of vagabonds, we explored the mall.  Did we need any 
            Penshoppe shirts?  (Andy did.)  Toys?  (I weighed the issue.)  Gadgets and gizmos?  (NO!)  Sneakers?  Japanese linen?  Finally, on the ground floor, Michael and 
            I purchased two dozen packs of dried mangoes, because God knows Costco in the States doesn’t carry enough of them.</p>
          <p>We were killing time.  Three hours would have to be strung up and slaughtered before dinner at six at Ariston’s place.  Why couldn’t Padma and I have had 
            some of these idle minutes the evening before, to spend reminiscing over a glass of lemonade, recalling our days of duck sauce?  A line from Hodgson appeared 
            unbidden in my mind’s eye, like breaking news on cable crawling across the screen.  “…Time, you old gypsy man…will you not stay?”  But when he does stay, he 
            crosses his feet and stares blankly at you.  “I’m all yours,” the gypsy declares.  “Then I gotta go.”</p>
          <p>Everyone was going to be at Ariston’s party that night, adults and children, a grand get-together, including Colton Faverty and his wife Peta.</p>
          <p>I had never met Colton or Peta, but I dearly desired to do so.</p>
          <p>A long time ago, when I was fifteen years old, I was a Rotary exchange student in Salem, Oregon.  For six months I lived with the Fraley family on Dogwood Drive.  
            Ray and Sandy were my foster parents; their children were Dan, Susan and John.  Dan was the eldest, a year younger than I was.  The Fraleys had a dog, a pool table, 
            and hearts as wide as the Willamette Valley.  They introduced me to America; they created the American in me.  It was on their driveway that I first felt the tingle 
            of snow on my skin.  Ray, whom I called “Dad,” taught me to ski, and forever shamed me into avoiding Star Trek on television, no matter what the episode.  The 
            Fraleys and I grew close; so close that Ray and I have continued to stay in touch via email and Priority packages.  I’m fifty-six now; that’s a lot of staying in 
            touch.</p>
          <p>The Fraleys had a piano, on which I practiced my lessons.  Susan played the instrument also.  I don’t know if she still plays the piano.  I scarcely do.  I do 
            know Susan grew out of her braces, grew to adulthood, married, had children, and now lives in Washington State.  Susan married Mr. Chris Faverty, and Colton is 
            their son.</p>  
          <p>Colton is about Andy’s age, and works in the ministry in Australia.  He and his wife, along with a team of Christians, were on the same green island—out of all 
            the islands in all the archipelagos and atolls on the planet—that I was vacationing in.  They were spreading God’s Word; I was reconnecting with family, and pigging 
            out on halo-halo.  The odds had been astronomically against the probability that I and Susan’s son, in the same week, out of all the weeks of our lives, would find 
            ourselves in Cebu.  Meeting Colton, for me, would be a kind of reconnection with the past, a truer merging, in a way, than blood ties being affirmed.  Colton was 
            the nephew I had never met—my unsuspected nephew—the envoy of a providential happenstance.</p>
          <p>But first my driver had to pick him up that afternoon.  It was 3:30 p.m. on my Seiko.  The driver would already be on his way to Danao.</p>
          <p>Trailing Gus, I was admiring some furniture in an export showroom when a message came for me on Gus’s Blackberry.  It was from Colton, sent some hours prior, 
            informing me that they were stranded in Bogo.  Apparently their bus had never shown up, and it wasn’t clear how they were to leave for Danao.</p>
          <p>I stopped in my tracks and sat on a rattan chair, Gus’s device in hand.  I felt that fate had played the proverbial cruel joke on me.  Perhaps Colton had 
            overplayed his hand, and I mine, in our attempt to bluff the house.  Was this a test of faith?  A trick of Satan’s?  My left brain told me it was simply a case of 
            one piece of the puzzle not falling into place, one stubborn domino remaining upright.  Our arrangements had been sabotaged by one volitional atom inside an idiot’s 
            head, and so no bus had shown up in Bogo, and now my driver would wait in vain in Danao for his two passengers.</p>
          <p>Oh Susan, my sister!  I wanted to meet Colton so!  I had a gift for Peta, which Adrian was to bring to Ariston’s house.  I had a succinct statement planned; there 
            was to be grilled fish and fresh fruit for Colton’s taste buds from Down Under.  Now the whole family would not be there!</p>
          <p>The chorus in my Greek tragicomedy cried its lament: “Bummer.  What a bummer.”</p>
          <p>A day later, when Colton and Peta finally made it to Danao, I was on the southern tip of the province, virtually lost in the vortex of cosmic chance.  Colton and 
            I would have to meet another way, on an even more improbable rendezvous.  Only time would tell how.</p>  
          <p>“Time to go,” said Gus.  “Liz and Virgie should be done with their facials.”  I handed Gus his Blackberry.  My flip phone, oblivious to the world, lay in a 
            drawer in Mama’s house.  I felt like joining it, shutting down, making no plans that could be unmade so readily.</p>
          <p>But life went on, dragged along by the imperatives of a schedule.</p>  
          <p>Mama and Adrian were already there when we arrived.  Ariston knew about the letdown regarding Colton’s appointment with us.  It was his employee we had dispatched 
            to Danao.  I told Ariston I appreciated everything he had done, and looking about, I saw the extent of his efforts.  Food on the table, drinks in the cooler, maids 
            crowding the kitchen.  Outside, fish was indeed being grilled over charcoal.  The TV was on, the air conditioner too, the ceiling fan whirring desperately.  Every 
            seat was taken.  Andrew and his family were there.  Ariston’s daughters, Chalcie, Kwai Kwai and Aira, took turns interrogating Liz and Andy, taking photos on their 
            smart phones.  Michael was all smiles.  Adrian busied himself with his plate.  Gus was on a motorized massage chair, fiddling with the remote control.  Mama and Joy 
            caught up on family news.  I was admiring Ariston’s collection of Marvel Comics action figures, arranged grandiosely on an étagère in the living room.</p>  
          <p>“Joy lets you display them here?” I inquired of my brother.</p>
          <p>“Sure.  The warehouse in back is for business.”</p>
          <p>Ariston was an entrepreneur.  He owned a manpower and rental-car agency, and had a garment business on the side.  Always on the go, behind the wheel in Bohol or 
            at his desk.  The house on Kansas Street, where Mama lived, actually belonged to Ariston.  The house we were presently in, hot with servants and relatives, and 
            pungent with spices, was owned by one of Joy’s uncles.  No organizational chart is forthcoming.  The Lee family tree, represented in that home, suffices to tell 
            the story of our trip to Cebu.  Son number seven, Adonis, resides in Arizona, and our sister Angel, born child number seven, lives in Illinois, twenty minutes 
            from my house.  Angel is Mrs. Yaung and has one boy; Adonis has a wife, two sons and two step-sons.  Had they all been at the party with us, we might have had to 
            ask several of the servants to step outside, to make room in the house.</p>
          <p>Evening came; the eighth day.
