        <h3>Refunding Yesterday</h3></div>
        <div class="content"><b><p>I awoke to find my family asleep.  In the dark, snug in their economy-class cardboard tray, were my eggs, happily unbroken.  Liz and 
          Michael Patterson, only eleven months married; their heads together in deep slumber as, hopefully, they would be in a waking crisis.  Andy, next to them, slumped 
          over his backpack, the cords from his earbuds dangling from his head, like mucous.  Virginia, beside me—the most precious one of all, a Slovakian Faberge egg.  
          In 1992, on the way to Cebu, Andy had traveled the whole way in a Snuggly baby carrier, he the joey and I the mama kangaroo.  Elizabeth we drugged with Benadryl.  
          Young Elizabeth and Andy had the comely features common to mixed-race children.  They traced their ancestry to southern China and Eastern Europe—we called them, 
          up until their adolescence, our “Chinese Czechers.”  Now they were adults, and I was a much older kangaroo, alive but only half-heartedly kicking.</p>  
     <p>It was raining in Incheon when we landed.  I had hoped to fill our three-hour layover with a free transit tour which would have taken us to an outlying temple.  We, in 
          that event, could have seen a bit of Korea—farm fields, an overpass and, as the brochure promised, nearby Yonggunsa temple.  But the rain ruined my plan, and in 
          any case Michael had been the only one willing to try the tour.  Had I been traveling alone, I most certainly would have gone to the temple, even if I had previously 
          visited Seoul in my twenties.  Give me ten days and I could “hop-on” and “hop-off” Madrid, Barcelona, Geneva, Nice and Toledo, as I did in 1998, with stamina and 
          granola bars as my only provisions on the train.  Rain would have been an inconvenience, not an obstacle.  Perhaps I wasn’t that old of a kangaroo after all.  
          Perhaps the challenge itself determined my resourcefulness.  Perhaps I didn’t relish being on my butt for three hours, looking at airport shops whose inventory 
          never moved, or changed, or went on sale.</p>
     <p>It was still misty when we took off again.</p>
     <p>Twelve hours later, we were in Detroit.  We had left Cebu just past midnight on Friday, July 29th, and after jetting over the top of the planet, traveling for twenty 
          hours, we landed on the opposite side early in the afternoon of the same day, Friday.  We had gotten our refund from Father Time, who understands all about the 
          International Date Line, and was happy to oblige us.</p>  
     <p>“I’ll get you someday,” Father Time winked, which made us shudder.</p>
     <p>A half-hour before our flight to Chicago, there came a dread announcement over the intercom: Our flight was delayed due to bad weather at O’Hare.</p>
     <p>The passengers at our gate did not groan; they appeared nonchalant.  But within their individual skulls, variations on the same question popped up:</p>
     <p>“Thirty minutes?”</p>
     <p>“A three-hour delay?”</p>
     <p>“Thirty-three hours?”</p>
     <p>The voice that had made the announcement sounded familiar.  And then the shock of recognition:</p>
<p>“I’ll get you someday.  I’ll get you somehow.”</p> 
     <p>I haggled with him.  “Let it be a thirty-minute delay,” I pleaded.  But Father Time, clutching his hourglass, said, “You know Mother Nature’s whims.  I can’t control 
          her.  I can only charge you for the time.  You had ten beautiful days in Cebu!  And you’re crying over this?  Would you rather be up over Lake Michigan tumbling 
          about, spilling your orange juice on your oxygen mask?  You want to talk to my brother—the guy in the black hood carrying a scythe?”</p>
     <p>I bowed out of the argument.  Compared to a scythe, an hourglass seemed like a Christmas ornament.</p> 
     <p>I looked at my basket of eggs, each one unperturbed and uncracked.  My son and daughter had unearthed their roots in the islands, while I had become reacquainted with 
          the intimate human scale of my family tree.  Michael had broadened his horizon to match Marco Polo’s.  Virginia had acquired her photographs of my relatives and 
          ancestors, genealogical material for some future Shutterfly project.  We had all eaten a ton of halo-halo.  Though my favorite fruit in the world, the cayamito, 
          had not been in season while I was in Cebu, persimmons would soon be available in the county of Du Page, where I paid my taxes.  In my carry-on was the stone 
          from Flushing Meadows Resort in Bohol—the stone which I had singled out for my collection at home, to add to the pile I owned from all the national parks and 
          foreign cities that I had set foot in.  One day, if Father Time gives me leave, I will toss that stone—maybe all my collected stones—back into a brook, or a 
          beach, or a well; returning them, not to the place of their origin, but to the place of their destiny, and of mine.</p> 
     <p>The weather cleared over Chicago, and our plane was cleared for takeoff.  There was some turbulence during the ensuing flight, which helped my marriage.  Virginia 
          clung to my arm as the plane shook.  I remained calm, cushioned by the twin pillows of religion and philosophy.  Turbulence is unnerving due, not so much to the 
          actual shaking of the aircraft, but to the fact of our suddenly perceived vulnerability.  One rogue cloud or bolt of lightning, and we were all toast.  But 
          consider that one miniscule miscalculation in our cell biology can kill us just as easily.  The physics and chemistry governing our planet sometimes pinch us, 
          and sometimes impale us, but at all times they impinge on us.  One moment we are animate; the next minute medics are carrying us out on a stretcher.  It is 
          only by God’s grace and through His ingenuity that we do not feel any turbulence as the earth rotates on its axis while it revolves around the sun, which is 
          swinging along the edge of the galaxy, among the twinkling stars and fiery nebulas rushing toward their own destiny—so many smooth stones thrown aloft by the 
          hand of God.</p>  
     <p>You can either believe in the grace of God, or else bet, as the plane is lurching, that the flight attendants will continue to serve peanuts to the passengers.  If 
          the stewardesses start shrieking, you will have lost your bet, and will wish that you were back in Detroit or Cebu—anywhere but at D. Alighieri Infernal Airport, 
          where the shops display nothing but fire extinguishers, all there since time immemorial, and all there just for show anyway, to torture you with expired hope.  
          Certainly it is true that if you trust in God, you may still crash to the ground.  But in that case, you would instantly go on a connecting flight in a chariot, 
          an angel by your side telling you about the eternal-flyer miles you’ve just earned.</p>  
     <p>But we made it.</p>
     <p>O’Hare was a hubbub of activity.  A multitude of travelers stood in a looping line before the immigration counters.  On a large screen, Barack Obama was welcoming 
          everyone to the United States of America.  I studied Obama’s face the way, in 1989, a student demonstrator in Tiananmen Square might have stared at Mao Tse-tung’s 
          giant portrait.  Love him or loathe him, the guy was everywhere.</p>
     <p>I was surprised that the government bothered to check our identities.  I imagined walking up to an immigration officer, and testing his level of political correctness.</p>
     <p>“I am,” I would declare, “a Syrian refugee.  My parents were Chinese Communists, as you can see from the shape of my eyes and the fork on my tongue.  I behead infidels 
          and stir-fry their ears, but only in my spare time, and never with MSG.”</p>
     <p>“Do you have your papers with you, sir?” the officer would ask.</p>
     <p>“No.  My coyotaje ate my papers.”</p>
     <p>“I’m sorry,” the officer would explain, “but we’ve run out of forms for asylum-seekers.  You can always self-identify as a Mexican migrant though.  We’d let you in.”</p>
     <p>“Where can I get a burrito around here?”</p>
     <p>“A burrito!” the officer would protest behind the glass partition.  “As soon as you enter the United States, sir, you become an American!  This is Chicago.  You get 
          a hot dog.”</p>
     <p>“No ketchup, si?”</p>
     <p>“That’s right.  Think like an American.”</p>  
     <p>Beaming, the immigration officer would point to a desk.  “Proceed there,” he would instruct me with bland imperiousness.  “That’s where you sign up for your 
          entitlements and benefits.  Welcome to America!”</p>
     <p>Instead, however, I answered the officer truthfully when it was my turn to be interviewed.</p>
     <p>“While in the Philippines,” I said, “I stayed in my mother’s home and swam in the sea.”  I wanted to add: “…And I did not, while swimming, tease or touch any 
          whale sharks.  I left the tarsiers as I found them, napping.  I ate no dog meat—though I hear it’s good with Chianti and some fava beans.  I was helpless to 
          help the people of Pasil.  And at the airport I forgot to kiss my own dear mother goodbye.”</p>
     <p>But the immigration officer was not a priest, Jesuit or otherwise, so I desisted from saying my confession.</p>
     <p>“So your trip was for pleasure?”</p> 
     <p>“Should I feel guilty?” I asked.</p> 
     <p>Though he was empowered to detain me for my impertinence, the federal agent let my remark slide.</p>
     <p>In fact, all five of us were allowed back into the country.</p>
     <p>The same taxi driver who had dropped us off twelve days prior now picked us up in front of Terminal 3.  It was 6:30 in the evening; we were two hours late, but the 
          driver had known about the flight delay from an app on his iPhone.  His name was Bill.  I wish he had had an app which told him what to wear when picking up 
          passengers in his Dodge Caravan.  Shorts and white socks and leather sandals do not convey a professional appearance.  But Bill was punctual, and that was the 
          important thing.</p>
     <p>He took us home.  It cost $61 to go from O’Hare to West Chicago when it had cost $59 to go from West Chicago to O’Hare.  The City of Big Shoulders, in charge of the 
          airport, exacted a two-dollar surcharge from its end.</p>
     <p>We were back in Illinois.
